PRODUCTS LIABILITY AND ACCIDENTS
INVOLVING AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
Jeffrey K. Gurneyt
Abstract
Autonomous vehicles will revolutionize society in the near future.
Computers, however, are not perfect, and accidents will occur while the
vehicle is in autonomous mode. This Article answers the question of who
should be liable when an accident is caused in autonomous mode. This Article
addresses the liability of autonomous vehicle by examining products liability
through the use of four scenarios: the Distracted Driver; the Diminished
Capabilities Driver; the Disabled Driver; and the Attentive Driver.
Based on those scenarios, this Article suggests that the autonomous
technology manufacturer should be liable for accidents caused in autonomous
mode because the autonomous vehicle probably caused the accident. Liability
should shift back to the "driver" depending on the nature of the driver and the
ability of that person to prevent the accident. Thus, this Article argues that an
autonomous vehicle manufacturer should be liable for accidents caused in
autonomous mode for the Disabled Driver and partially for the Diminished
Capabilities Driver and the Distracted Driver. This Article argues the
Attentive Driver should be liable for most accidents caused in autonomous
vehicles. Currently, products liability does not allocate the financial
responsibility of an accident to the party that is responsible for the accident,
and this Article suggests that courts and legislatures need to address tort
liability for accidents caused in autonomous mode to ensure that the
responsible party bears responsibility for accidents.

test-driving under a variety of conditions, and this autonomous car has not
been involved in a single accident.7
Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google, is predicting that Google Cars will be
available for public use in five years.8  General Motors predicts that self-
driving cars will be on the road within the decade.9 Stanford Law School is
already teaching a course on the law of autonomous driving.o In preparation
for the widespread use of self-driving cars, states are beginning to pass
autonomous vehicle laws.12 Nevada was the first state to pass an autonomous
vehicle law,'3  and it utilizes special license plates designated solely for
autonomous vehicles.14  Florida has also passed an autonomous vehicle law.

JOURNAL OF LAW, TECHNOLOGY & POLICY
California Governor Jerry Brown "drove" an autonomous car to Google's
headquarters to sign his state's autonomous vehicle law. The National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is currently researching
autonomous vehicle technology to develop appropriate regulations.'7  The
NHTSA does not, however, recommend that states allow for public use of
autonomous vehicles until the vehicles can be further researched.'8
Nonetheless, the NHTSA states that "it is encouraged by innovations in
automated driving and their potential to transform our roadways."19 Other
states, however, are delaying passing autonomous vehicles laws until a liability
20scheme can be adopted. In those states that have passed an autonomous
21vehicle law, no state permits driverless autonomous cars yet.
States' preemptive passing of legislation indicates that they are very
accepting of autonomous cars, probably because of the benefits these cars will
provide to citizens of their respective states. Since human driver errors cause
22most automobile deaths, autonomous vehicles should increase highway
safety. The World Health Organization states that around 1.3 million people
23per year worldwide die from car accidents. In 2010, 32,885 Americans died
24 2in car accidents, and over 2.2 million people were injured in a vehicle.25
Worldwide, Google and other car manufacturers argue that autonomous
vehicles will reduce the number of car accident fatalities and injuries resulting

from human error because the computer controlling the autonomous vehicle
does not get tired, intoxicated, or distracted as does the human driver.26
Apart from the incalculable intrinsic value of life and limb, reducing car
accidents could result in significant cost savings. Automobile accidents in the
United States cost around 300 billion dollars per year, as measured in deaths,
27 health care, and property loss.2 Traffic congestion costs are measured around
100 billion dollars. By reducing the number of accidents that occur, Google
Cars and other autonomous vehicles can greatly reduce these costs.29
Additionally, the autonomous vehicle will increase fuel efficiency, which
will help protect the environment and save consumers money.30 In 2007 alone,
Americans used 2.8 billion gallons of excess gasoline at a financial cost of 87.2
billion dollars. 3' Autonomous vehicles will greatly improve fuel efficiency by
harmonizing traffic flow.32

of much discussion, this Article does not question the functionality or the
usefulness of autonomous cars, but rather seeks to examine how tort liability

computers are not perfect,34 it is practical to assume that self-driving cars will
sometimes malfunction,35 and it is important to examine tort liability when
such malfunctions result in a car accident.36 Specifically, who is liable when
the car malfunctions and causes an accident while in autonomous mode; should
the driver or the manufacturer be liable?37 Because current products liability
law does not adequately assess liability in this futuristic situation, this Article
proposes that courts or legislatures need to adopt a new liability scheme that
assesses responsibility to the proper party by using products liability principles
and focuses on the driver's level of reliance on the autonomous vehicle.
In examining that issue, this Article first discusses projected designs for
autonomous vehicles-focusing specifically on the Google Car-as well as the
purposes of these cars. Part 11 describes four hypothetical scenarios that will
be used in exploring products liability law. Part III provides an overview of
the current products liability doctrines that govern product manufacturers, how
those doctrines will apply to accidents involving autonomous technology, and
shortfalls of each as applied to autonomous vehicles. Finally, Part IV asserts
that adjustments to current products liability doctrines are necessary to ensure
that tort liability stemming from autonomous vehicle accidents is allocated to
the proper parties.

Google plans to combine its autonomous technology with preexisting
vehicles, rather than develop its own vehicle specifically for autonomous
driving. Currently, Google is testing its technology on a fleet of Toyota
Priuses,40 an Audi, and a Lexus.42 Google places a structure on top of the car
that navigates, detects traffic, and measures and analyzes the surroundings
through the use of radar sensors, laser rangefinders, video cameras, global
positioning systems (GPSs), and maps.43 The laser rangefinders map out the
driving environment, "[t]he cameras and vehicle radars ... detect potential
obstacles,"" and the GPS determines the location of the vehicle to help it stay
45on the correct path. This information is sent to Google data centers that use
this data to constantly update the maps sent out to all Google Cars,46 which
helps other autonomous cars that come across that location.47 Developers then
refine the algorithms this technology utilizes by driving the cars in various
48terrains. The interior of the vehicle has a user interface to help drivers
monitor what the autonomous technology is currently doing.49
Although Google plans to develop a fully autonomous vehicle, its current
design-and the current laws-still requires a driver behind the steering
wheel.50  The driver is able to assume control of the vehicle by moving the
steering wheel or touching the pedals.51  The driver can also assume control of
the vehicle by utilizing a button that switches the vehicle in or out of self-
driving mode.52 If the vehicle does not realize what to do in a certain driving
situation, a voice lets the user know that the car is giving control back to the
driver.53
Autonomous vehicles have the capability to communicate with each

movements."). Continental Corporation's autonomous vehicle, for instance, uses "four short-range radar

other.54  As they become more common, autonomous vehicles will become
safer because of this feature, which further removes a level of unpredictability
for the computer-human behavior. The vehicles will also be able to
56communicate with traffic signals and signs. Because of these abilities, the
benefits of autonomous cars will greatly increase as they become more
common.
2. Purposes of the Autonomous Vehicle
While the designs of autonomous vehicles may change over time, the
primary purpose of autonomous vehicles is to get the user from one place to
another. For most people, traditional vehicles also serve this purpose;
however, autonomous vehicles also assist those who cannot safely drive
themselves.57  "Too many people are underserved by the current transport
system. They are blind, or too young to drive, or too old, or intoxicated."58
Google demonstrated the capacity for autonomous vehicles to change this
aspect of the transportation system when it allowed a blind person to "drive"
the vehicle to run some errands.

Another purpose of autonomous vehicles not served by traditional
vehicles is to increase a person's productivity.60  The autonomous car will
allow people behind the wheel to perform tasks other than driving. In
today's productivity-driven society, this aspect of autonomous vehicles is very
appealing.
B. Four Scenarios
In order to further analyze autonomous cars and the interplay of tort
liability, it is helpful to examine four specific scenarios: the Distracted Driver,
the Diminished Capabilities Driver, the Disabled Driver, and the Attentive
Driver.
1. The Distracted Driver
Sarah has a long drive home for Thanksgiving right before her finals
begin. Traditionally, she would not make the trip home so that she could
study, but now, because of Google, Sarah can do both. She gets into her
Google Car-a fully autonomous vehicle-with her torts textbook, and,
instead of driving home, she rides in the driver seat while reading her textbook.
The Google Car is driving for her and notifying her when she needs to pay
attention to the road. About halfway home, the Google Car malfunctions and
hits another driver without ever telling Sarah to take control of the car.
Arguably, Sarah's car caused the accident. Who is liable? Is Sarah-the
driver in the traditional sense-liable, or is Google-the manufacturer-liable
because the car was driving itself when the accident occurred?
The Distracted Driver is the autonomous car user who is not paying
attention;62 it could be someone reading a book like Sarah, using a cell
phone, eating a snack, or any other situation. Essentially, the Distracted
Driver purposefully engages in a task other than driving, thus relying on the
blind-passenger-to-taco-bell/.
60. See Urmson, supra note 6 ("One day we hope this capability will enable people to be more
productive in their cars."); see also Markoff, supra note 26 (quoting Sebastian Thrun, Director of the Stanford
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and Google engineer: "Can we text twice as much while driving, without
guilt? ... Yes, we can, if only cars will drive themselves."); Thrun, supra note 46 ("[T]he U.S. Department of
Transportation estimates that people spend on average 52 minutes each working day commuting. Imagine
being able to spend that time more productively."). Another car maker, Volvo, has likewise stated the goal of
increasing productivity of people. See Press Release, Volvo Car Grp., supra note 17 ("[Autonomous
technology] creat[cs] possibilities for the driver to safely focus on something else while the car is driven
autonomously.").
61. Currently each American on average spends an hour per day in a vehicle. Smith, supra note 31, at
1410. See also Nick Bilton, Disruptions: How Driverless Cars Could Reshape Cities, N.Y. TIMES (July 7,
2013, 11:00 AM), http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/07/disruptions-how-driverless-cars-could-reshape-

autonomous vehicle completely.
2. The Diminished Capabilities Driver
Richard is in his eighties. At one time Richard was a superb driver, but,
as he has aged, driving has become more difficult for him. He struggles when
turning his head to look for traffic, and he does not react at the same speed as
he once did. Richard does not want to depend on others for his travels, so he
purchases an autonomous vehicle. This vehicle allows Richard to safely get
from one place to another without depending on others. On the way to his
grandchild's Little League Baseball game, the vehicle starts malfunctioning.
Richard attempts to take control of the vehicle but does not react quickly
enough to avoid the accident, and the vehicle hits another car. Is Richard
liable or is Google?
The Diminished Capabilities Driver is the person whose driving
capabilities are diminished for some reason; it could be an elderly person like
Richard, an intoxicated person,64 or a minor. This person typically would not
be driving because of his or her diminished capabilities and would have to rely
on others.66 Thus, the Diminished Capabilities Driver could benefit greatly
from the convenience and independence an autonomous vehicle provides.
3. The Disabled Driver67
Christie enlists in the army and serves her country. A tragedy occurs
overseas: Christie is hit by a grenade, and she is permanently blinded by
shrapnel that hits her eyes. Upon returning home, she finds herself completely
dependent on others to drive her places, but she does not like to burden family
and friends with her disability. Fortunately, she learns of a new technology
that will give her independence and the ability to get around. She purchases an
autonomous car. One day, on her way to the local VFW, Christie's
autonomous vehicle begins malfunctioning and alerting her of the technology
failure. Because Christie is blind and cannot assume control of the vehicle, she
can only sit there and pray for the best. Is Christie liable or is Google?
64. See Douma & Palodichuk, supra note 33, at 1163-64 (discussing the possibility of a "take me home
I'm drunk" button for these cars).
65. Obviously children cannot currently operate a motor vehicle, but many people have suggested that
autonomous vehicles could eventually be used to drive children to their sporting events and schools, increasing
society's productivity even more. E.g., Douma & Palodichuk, supra note 33, at 1164; Smith, supra note 31, at
1409.
66. This Article does not ignore the fact that Diminished Capability Drivers, while relying on the
autonomous technology, could be undertaking other activities while in the vehicle much like Distracted
Drivers. The difference between the two drivers is that the Distracted Driver can-other than for the
distraction-drive the vehicle in a safe manner; whereas the Diminished Capabilities Driver has a condition
that makes it harder for the person to drive the vehicle safely.
67. This Article does not ignore the practical reality that states would have to pass laws allowing people
with disabilities to have an autonomous vehicle. Currently, people with disabilities of this sort cannot operate
a motor vehicle. States may create a public policy exception for autonomous vehicles. Google has already
allowed a blind person to drive the vehicle. See Quirk, supra note 59 (discussing the car taking the blind man
through Taco Bell's drive-thru).256 [Vol. 2013
SUE MY CAR NOT ME
The Disabled Driver is the person who cannot drive a traditional vehicle
because of a physical disability, such as blindness6 or an amputated limb.69
Thus, the Disabled Driver relies entirely on the autonomous nature of the car in
that he or she can take control-just not safely-of the autonomous car in the
event of a computer malfunction.
4. The Attentive Driver
Tucker commutes forty-five minutes to work five days a week. He has
grown tired of making this commute, considering that he spends an hour and a
half doing nothing "productive." Tucker hears about autonomous vehicles.
Tucker has a healthy skepticism of new technology, so it takes time for him to
get comfortable using technology, even when the product has been out for
years. Nevertheless, Tucker decides to try an autonomous vehicle so that he
can use his commuting time more productively. At first, Tucker does not take
his eyes off the road, but eventually he starts to trust the vehicle. One day
Tucker watches his autonomous vehicle drift into the other lane. Rather than
grab the wheel, he watches to see if his car is actually as perfect as it had
previously been and if it will fix itself, avoiding the accident. Unfortunately,
there is a vehicle in his blind spot, and Tucker's autonomous vehicle collides
with the other vehicle. Is Tucker liable for not taking control of the
autonomous vehicle, or is Google?
The Attentive Driver, like Tucker, is the user who watches the road and
surroundings in the same way he or she would while driving a traditional
vehicle. The Attentive Driver may not trust the autonomous ability of the
vehicle such that he or she constantly checks that the car is driving correctly, or
the Attentive Driver may simply not have any other tasks to address while in
the vehicle. The key is that the Attentive Driver has the potential to foresee
and prevent accidents, unlike the Distracted, Diminished Capabilities, and
Disabled Drivers.
III. PRODUCTS LIABILITY LAW AS APPLIED TO AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
A. Overview ofProducts Liability Law
Products liability is the main basis for manufacturer liability. Plaintiffs
can sue for manufacturing defects, design defects, and failures to warn.70
Crashworthiness is another products liability doctrine applied to automobiles.
However, since this analysis is focusing on Google Cars and crashworthiness
is concerned with the structure and design of the vehicle, the analysis of a

even when wearing glasses or contact lenses."').

JOURNAL OF LAW, TECHNOLOGY & POLICY
vehicle's crashworthiness would be the same for a vehicle with autonomous
technology and one without autonomous technology.72 A products liability
suit can allege any or all of these theories.73 Manufacturing defects are
implicated when a good is not produced according to its specification 7 or
under the malfunction doctrine when there is an unexplainable accident.75
Design defects are alleged when the foreseeable risks of harm could have been
reduced or avoided by use of a reasonable alternative design.76 There are two
main tests for design defects: the consumer expectations test and the risk-utility
test.77  A failure to warn claim is based on a manufacturer's duty to provide
instruction about how the product can be safely used and to warn consumers of
hidden dangers.78  In Part III.B, this Article will analyze autonomous cars
under each of the three common grounds for products liability suits-
manufacturing defect, design defect, and warning defect. In Part III.B.5, this
Article will also examine the defenses to products liability suits. There are
four defenses that are applicable to autonomous vehicle suits: comparative
negligence, misuse, state of the art, and assumption of the risk.79
B. Products Liability Doctrines Applied to Autonomous Vehicles
1. Manufacturing Defects
Manufacturing defects occur when the product does not meet the
manufacturer's specifications and standards.80  The Restatement (Second) of
Torts and the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability both include a
manufacturing defect claim for products liability.si To succeed, a plaintiff
must prove that the product does not conform to the specifications, regardless
of whether there was negligence in the manufacturing process.82
In the context of autonomous vehicles, a plaintiff could prevail by
showing that the autonomous equipment failed to work as specified by the
72. Google is planning on putting the autonomous technology on cars produced by other manufacturers
and is not using a special car. See supra note 5 and accompanying text. Because of that, the crashworthiness
analysis would be the same for the vehicle that Google uses for its technology.
73. Watson, 699 S.E.2d at 174.
74. See RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS § 402A cmt. h (1965) ("The defective condition may arise
not only from harmful ingredients, not characteristic of the product itself either as to presence or quantity, but
also from foreign objects contained in the product, from decay or deterioration before sale, or from the way in
which the product is prepared or packed.").

SUE MY CAR NOT ME
manufacturer.83  For instance, if the laser sensors do not detect oncoming
traffic or when to turn, like the specifications require, then the user should be
able to recover under a manufacturing defect claim. Manufacturing defects
claims in the autonomous vehicle context face a significant complication:
courts have not applied the manufacturing defect doctrine to software because
nothing tangible is manufactured.84 Because of this, a plaintiff will not be able
to allege under a manufacturing defect theory that the software erred, rather the
plaintiff will want to allege that the autonomous technology did not meet
manufacturing specifications. This will be tricky for a plaintiff to do if the
defect is really a software error (algorithm). Therefore, the traditional
manufacturing defect theory will be most useful to plaintiffs when the parts did
not meet the manufacturing specifications.
Under the malfunction doctrine, a variation of the manufacturing defect
doctrine, a plaintiff can show a manufacturing defect without specifically
proving how it was defective.86 A plaintiff must prove that: "(1) the product
malfunctioned, (2) the malfunction occurred during proper use, and (3) the
product had not been altered or misused in a manner that probably caused the
malfunction."87 The major benefit to the malfunction doctrine is that a plaintiff
can prove that the product malfunctioned with circumstantial evidence.
This doctrine's application to autonomous vehicles helps a plaintiff hold a
manufacturer liable for the accident. A plaintiff could prove that the accident
was caused by a malfunction in the autonomous technology.89  The accident
itself is proof of the first and second elements.91 The third element requires a
plaintiff to prove that the vehicle was not altered, such as by simply showing
that the car is in its original condition. Presumably the technology will be
programmed differently for each vehicle's specifications because each vehicle
may accelerate faster, have different brake systems, and other unique abilities
of cars.92 If the vehicle owner changed any part of the vehicle, a manufacturer
83. Cf Marchant & Lindor, supra note 33, at 1323 (arguing that manufacturing defect claims will be
uncommon because software and navigation systems are manufactured with low error rates).

89. See, e.g., 68 AM. JUR. 3D PROOF OF FACTS § 1 (2013) (suggesting that technology that fails to meet
product specifications may be classified as "defective" and give rise to a cause of action).
90. The accident is evidence that the automobile malfunctioned. See Dietz v. Waller, 685 P.2d 744,
747-48 (Ariz. 1984) ("No specific defect need be shown if the evidence, direct or circumstantial, permits the
inference that the accident was caused by a defect.").
91. Proof of proper use would be that the vehicle is in autonomous mode. The only problem with this
element would occur if the autonomous car was not permitted to be operated in certain weather conditions.
See Marchant & Lindor, supra note 33, at 1327 (mentioning the possibility that a manufacturer may include in
the manual instructions that the owner should not use the car under certain weather conditions).
92. This would be different if the person could download an update or if the technology adapts to the
vehicle.No. 2] 259
JOURNAL OF LAW, TECHNOLOGY & POLICY
will always argue that any modification to the vehicle changed the
technology's ability to safely drive in autonomous mode and, thus, was the
cause of the accident.93 Therefore, to use the malfunction doctrine, a plaintiff
will need to prove that the vehicle was not altered by any changes to the
vehicle that may have caused the program to malfunction or that the
technology was updated to meet the new vehicle modifications.94
Although the malfunction doctrine will be useful to plaintiffs in
autonomous vehicle products liability suits, there are some limitations to its
application. Some jurisdictions do not recognize the malfunction doctrine.95
Courts that do apply the doctrine hesitate to apply it to claims in a widespread
fashion96 and typically require a showing of unique circumstances before
applying it.97 When applying the doctrine to traditional vehicles, some courts
require that the vehicle was relatively new98 and that the vehicle part was not
repaired.99 An expert is usually required to show that the accident could not
have been caused by anything other than the alleged defect.00  These
limitations, along with the fact that some jurisdictions do not recognize the
malfunction doctrine, limit the usefulness of the doctrine, making it difficult to
apply for autonomous vehicles.
2. Design Defects
a. Consumer Expectations Test
A traditional manufacturing defect claim will not help plaintiffs with
algorithm defects because of the malfunction doctrine's limitations; so,
plaintiffs will likely assert design defects. This Part focuses on one of the
design defect tests. The Restatement (Second) of Torts includes the consumer

vehicles because of liability concerns).
94. Owen, supra note 75, at 873-74 ("The malfunction doctrine [provides that] plaintiff need not
establish that a specific defect caused an accident if circumstantial evidence permits an inference that the
product, in one way or another, probably was defective.").
95. See, e.g., Christopher H. Hall, Annotation, Strict Products Liability: Product Malfunction or
Occurrence ofAccident as Evidence ofDefect, 65 A.L.R. 4TH 346 (2013) (enumerating jurisdictions that do not
recognize the malfunction doctrine).
96. Owen, supra note 75, at 878 ("The doctrine presents a seductive but faulty shelter for plaintiffs with
insufficient proof of defect and causation, and the law reports brim with decisions that recite the propriety of
the doctrine as a general proposition but hold it inapplicable to the facts.").
97. DAVID G. OWEN, PRODucTs LIABILITY LAW § 7.4, at 470 (2d ed. 2008) ("Although the malfunction
doctrine may come to a plaintiffs rescue when circumstances fairly suggest the responsibility of a product
defect, it is hombook law that proof ofa product accident alone proves neither defectiveness nor causation.").
98. Compare Corcoran v. General Motors Corp., 81 F. Supp. 2d 55, 69 (D.D.C. 2000) ("[A]lthough
brake failure in a new car gives rise to the inference that a defect existed when the car entered the stream of

Corp., 271 N.W.2d 777, 779 (Mich. 1978) (reversing a directed verdict on malfunction theory for a four-year-

expectations test for design defects.102  Like the Restatement (Third), many
courts have criticized using the consumer expectations test for design
defects;'03 many states, however, still use this test. 104 The Restatement
(Second) of Torts defines a design defect as a defect that is unreasonably
dangerous beyond the contemplation of the consumer.' 05 A product has a
design defect if it is "dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be
contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchases it."'06  However, a
manufacturer is not required to make perfectly safe goods.107 Thus, under the
consumer expectations test, a court looks to what a reasonable consumer would
expect from a product.08
Because of the complexity of traditional automobiles,109 some courts
hesitate to apply the consumer expectations test to most automotive
accidents.1o Although autonomous technology could be considered
"complex," developing consumer expectations does not require knowledge of
the complexity.I' In the context of autonomous vehicles, the consumer will
expect the vehicle to operate on its own in a reasonably safe manner. The
manufacturer necessarily will need to advertise that the autonomous vehicle is
safe; otherwise no one will trust the vehicle. This advertising could also lead
consumers to have unrealistic expectations of the autonomous vehicle's
capabilities.112 When a car deviates from the consumer's expectations and
causes an accident, a consumer expectations jurisdiction should permit a
plaintiff to use this test. For instance, assume a situation where a vehicle's
map of a turn is defective and instead of turning left where it was supposed to,

the vehicle instead turns ten feet too early, driving the car into a ditch.
Because this accident would be a software defect, the plaintiff needs to assert a
design defect claim."3  Under the consumer expectations test, the driver's
expectation was that the maps would work properly and the vehicle would
follow those maps. In this example, the expectations were not complex. The
vehicle caused the accident, the autonomous vehicle did not meet the person's
expectations, and a court should allow the driver to present the consumer
expectations test to the jury.
Since the consumer expectations test is based on expectations of the
"reasonable consumer,"' 14 not the subjective expectations of the particular
consumer, it will not matter which of the four drivers1 is behind the wheel.
The expectations are based on the reasonable person and not the reasonable
Distracted Driver or the reasonable Diminished Capabilities Driver.116
Thus, although the Attentive Driver described in Part II has lower
"expectations" of the vehicle's capabilities to drive safely'"7 than, for instance,
the Distracted Driver,"8 a manufacturer could not argue that this attentive
plaintiff did not trust the vehicle to drive safely. Although the consumer
expectations test could apply to autonomous vehicles on a widespread basis, it
is not recognized for design defects in every jurisdiction, and those
jurisdictions that do recognize it may hesitate to do so in the context of
autonomous vehicles because they may argue that autonomous vehicles are
complex.
b. Risk-Utility Test
Because the consumer expectations test is applied to design defects in
only a minority of jurisdictions, most plaintiffs will need to use the risk-utility
test to prove a design defect.' 19 The risk-utility test is the dominant test for
design defects in products liability.120 The Restatement (Third) of Torts:
Products Liability endorsed the risk-utility test as the sole test for design
defects.121 Section 2(b) of that Restatement provides:
A product ... is defective in design when the foreseeable risks of
harm posed by the product could have been reduced or avoided by
the adoption of a reasonable alternative design by the seller ... and
the omission of the alternative design renders the product not

reasonably safe.122
A manufacturer is not required under the risk-utility test to use the safest
design possible.123 Rather, under the risk-utility test "[a] product is defective
in design if the safety benefits from altering the design as roposed by the
plaintiff would have exceeded the costs of such an alteration." To prevail, a
plaintiff must present a reasonable alternative design that would have
prevented the accident.125
In the autonomous vehicle context,126 design defect claims may allege a
defect in the design of some tangible feature of the autonomous vehicle or may
allege a defect in the software that controls the vehicle. For instance, a
plaintiff could allege that the sensors could have been designed better to
capture the surroundings of the automobiles. A plaintiffs design defect claim
against a manufacturer for the actual design of a tangible feature ordinarily will
be easier for a plaintiff to prove than for the design of the software because
presenting expert testimony on the positioning or technology is more
straightforward than presenting expert testimony on the ability of the
manufacturer to write a safer algorithm.127 Unfortunately, the majority of the
design defect cases will concern the algorithm because most of the accidents
will concern a computer malfunction. The software could cause the car to
accelerate faster than normal, it could have the vehicle miss a stop sign or red
light, or a variety of other incidents.129 Here, a plaintiff would need a highly
specialized expert to testify130 as to how the algorithm could have been written
(designed) in a safer manner that would have prevented the accident. Because
of the complexity of the lawsuit, the costs of a risk-utility suit and the difficulty
in having a qualified expert testify to the alleged design defect, this type of
claim will be hard to use widespread to hold the manufacturer liable for

8:03CV544T3IMSS, 2005 WL 3087864, at *13 (M.D. Fla. Nov. 16, 2005), the court permitted the plaintiffs
to assert a design defect when a plane crashed in autopilot but found that the plaintiffs did not introduce
enough evidence to support the claim. Therefore, it is likely that courts would also allow design defect claims
against autonomous vehicles.

may have to engage in a searching review of the computer code that directs the movement of these vehicles.
This project may be difficult, and expensive.").
128. See Marchant & Lindor, supra note 33, at 1328 ("[T]he malfunction in an autonomous vehicle will
usually be a programming error or system failure."). This occurs because the software will misinterpret an
object or fail to realize what something is. Id at 1327-28. This type of design defect challenges the software

129. Analogous to these examples are cruise control malfunctions. See, e.g., Cole v. Ford Motor Co.,
900 P.2d 1059 (Or. Ct. App. 1995). In the cruise control cases, the plaintiffs argue that the cruise control
accelerated rapidly or failed to disengage. Id at 1066. Likewise, with autonomous vehicles, the autonomous
vehicle technology could accelerate rapidly or fail to disengage.

accidents caused in autonomous mode.'31
Because of the limitations of the consumer expectations test and the
costliness of the risk-utility test, design defect claims will be tough for
plaintiffs to prove for an everyday accident and will be more likely to succeed
in cases involving the design of tangible features of the vehicle rather than the
software.
3. Failure to Warn
The final category of traditional products liability law is the warning
defect. There are two parts to the duty to warn: "informing buyers of hidden
dangers" and instructing buyers on how to safely use the product.132  The
Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability states that:
A product ... is defective because of inadequate instructions or
warnings when the foreseeable risks of harm posed by the product
could have been reduced or avoided by the provision of reasonable
instructions or warnings by the [manufacturer] ... and the omission
of the instructions or warnings renders the product not reasonably
safe.'33
This standard focuses on whether the warnings provided were
adequate.'34 These doctrines can be applied in the autonomous vehicle context
too. A main obligation of manufacturers imposed by the duty to warn will
involve letting consumers know of any dangers'35 a driver may face when
using the autonomous technology. For instance, if the vehicle is brought to a
particular location that the maps cannot identify, 36  the vehicle could
malfunction and cause harm. A consumer may not know that the vehicle
struggles in remote locations, and the manufacturer would have a duty to warn
the owner that the autonomous technology could malfunction or does not
operate properly there.
Perhaps the main basis for warning defects in the autonomous vehicle
context, however, will be the failure to instruct users on how to safely use the
autonomous vehicles. Because autonomous vehicles will be a new technology
and the risk of harm will be great if they are not operated properly,
manufacturers will need to make sure that consumers know how to operate

them. This may require a special instruction video'37 that users must watch
before purchasing vehicles equipped with autonomous technology. Another
alternative would be having driver's education classes cover autonomous
driving.'3 Regardless of the solution adopted, autonomous vehicle
manufacturers will need to make sure that consumers are instructed on how to
safely use these cars or manufacturers could be liable for breaching their duty
to warn consumers.
4. Evidence Issues
Under any of the products liability schemes listed above, two evidentiary
issues-expert testimony issues and subsequent remedial measures-will recur
in almost all autonomous vehicle products liability suits. Because of the
complexity of the technology, a plaintiff will need expert testimony to explain
product safety and accidents to the court and the jury, 39 which will make most
product liability suits cost prohibitive.
To illustrate how the cost of expert witnesses often will be cost
prohibitive, this Article will examine expert testimony in the design defect
context. With design defects, the major hurdle for a plaintiff to get over will
be finding evidence of a reasonable alternative design.140  Autonomous
vehicles by their very nature are futuristic and the car's movement is controlled
by algorithms.141 To prove defectiveness, a plaintiff will need an expert
witness to testify to a jury that the highly complex algorithm could have been
written safer and that the costs of discovering and implementing this new
algorithm would not exceed the benefits of doing so.142 This will presumably
require multiple experts:143 a computer scientist to understand the algorithm; a
mathematician to rewrite the equation; an economist to weigh the costs and
benefits of the change; and an expert in the field of autonomous vehicles to
137. The video would consist of showing the driver how to disengage autonomous driving, informing the
driver of how the vehicle interacts with the driver, and instructing the driver on how to operate the user
interface.
138. This solution would not be much help for current drivers, but would help ensure that the future
generations of drivers are instructed on how to use these vehicles. The NHTSA recommends states requiring
someone licensed to specifically operate autonomous vehicles. NHTSA, Preliminary Statement, supra note
18, at 14.
139. David G. Owen, A Decade of Daubert, 80 DENV. U. L. REV. 345, 347-48 (2002) ("Expert testimony
is often necessary to establish defectiveness in manufacture, design, and warning and instructions .... [A]
products liability case usually will fail without proof of defect and cause by expert testimony.").
140. See Watson v. Ford Motor Co., 699 S.E.2d 169, 174 (S.C. 2010) ("[Design defects] necessarily
involve sophisticated issues of engineering, technical science, and other complex concepts that arc
quintessentially beyond the ken of a lay person.").
141. See Owen, supra note 139, at 354 ("[T]he Frye 'general acceptance' test tended to exclude
testimony on cutting-edge science and technology."). Although Daubert has made it easier to get novel
theories in front ofajury, courts do not allow experts to testify about unreliable theories. Id. at 362-63.
142. Analogous to a future autonomous vehicle case is an auto-pilot case. In Richardson v. Bombardier,
Inc., No. 8:03CV544T31 MSS, 2005 WL 3087864, at *3 (M.D. Fla. Nov. 16, 2005), the district court noted the
multiple experts that were required, and because of the complex nature of the auto-pilot claim, "the entire case
was based on expert testimony."
143. Depending on the complexity of the suit, multiple experts will easily be required. See, e.g., Cole v.
Ford Motor Co., 900 P.2d 1059 (Or. Ct. App. 1995) (noting that multiple experts were required for cruise
control defect case).No. 2] 265
JOURNAL OF LAW, TECHNOLOGY & POLICY
make sure that this is possible and that it would not have adverse effects on the
vehicle. The cost of these experts will make it difficult for a plaintiff to bring
suit.144 When considering that a lawsuit for autonomous vehicles could be for
a dent in a car or a fender bender,145 the costs of acquiring experts will far
exceed the cost of repairing the vehicle. Therefore, design defect claims would
only go forward on claims for loss of life or large monetary claims because the
financial cost of bringing the suit would not exceed the potential judgment.
To help ease these costs, depending on the jurisdiction,146 a plaintiff will
be able to use a subsequent update in the algorithm or safety update as
evidence that there was a reasonable alternative design. In federal courts,
however, Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 407 prohibits introduction of
subsequent remedial measures.147 The ability to use a subsequent update to the
algorithm in state court will greatly improve a plaintiffs chance of success on
the design defect claim because it will remove costs associated with
developing an algorithm and proving the algorithm will help increase safety.
The plaintiff will need to file the claim in state court to avoid FRE 407's bar
against subsequent remedial measures. In any jurisdiction, a plaintiff will be
able to introduce updates to the algorithm-and algorithms used by competing
manufacturers-if they predate the accident48 but were not installed in the
plaintiffs car.149
Because of the costs of expert witnesses, none of these doctrines-
manufacturing defects, design defects, and warning defects-will be practical
to hold the manufacturer liable for accidents caused while the vehicle is in
autonomous mode except in cases involving substantial damages.
5. Products Liability Defenses as Applied to Autonomous Vehicles
Products liability law does not leave manufacturers defenseless against a
144. See Garza, supra note 33, at 612 ("Because of the extraordinary cost of experts in products liability
litigation, many plaintiffs are turned away because, even if they were to recover, the prospective award would
not cover the expense of litigating the claim." (citing Joseph Sanders, Adversarial Legalism and Civil
Litigation: Prospects for Change, 28 LAW & SOC. INQUIRY 719, 723 (2003))); Graham, supra note 33, at 1270
(arguing that a design defect "may be difficult, and expensive").
145. This Article asserts that the manufacturer should be liable for almost all damages caused while the
vehicle is in autonomous mode. See infra Part IV.

subsequent remedial measures to prove negligence, culpable conduct, product or design defects, or the need
for a warning or instruction.").

update, and the plaintiff did not update the algorithm, this could lead to comparative fault. See infra Part
Ill.B.3.

available updates are for autonomous cars. For instance, is an autonomous car owner required to go to the
dealership to get updates or will the technology be immediately updated by Google's headquarters? Answers
to these questions are not available yet, but the answers could have implications for subsequent remedial
updates to the algorithm.266 [Vol. 2013
SUE MY CAR NOT ME
products liability suit. Four defenses-comparative negligence, misuse, state
of the art, and assumption of risk-will be applicable to autonomous vehicles.
In products liability suits involving autonomous vehicles, the manufacturer
could raise a comparative negligence defense, arguing that it should not be
fully liable-or liable at all-because of the plaintiffs negligence.50 This
doctrine's interplay with the four scenarios discussed above is paramount.151
When applied to the four scenarios discussed in Part II, it becomes clear that
when evaluating the driver's negligence courts should focus on the driver's
decision not to intervene when the vehicle malfunctions.152 This would require
a comparison between the role of the defective vehicle and the role of the
plaintiffs conduct in causing the accident.'53  Here, the particular accident
would be the harm caused when the autonomous vehicle malfunctions-it may
be to the driver, to another vehicle or person, or both. This type of
comparative fault requires the court to focus on the ability of a driver to
exercise ordinary care in preventing the accident. If the driver fails to exercise
ordinary care, fault should be apportioned based on the driver's ability to
mitigate or prevent the accident.
If courts were to examine what a plaintiff was doing prior to the accident,
they would defeat a major purpose of these vehicles-increased
productivity.154 This occurs because avlaintiff who sits behind the wheel and
reads a book, like Sarah from Part II, would be more "negligent" in failing
to pay attention to the road than a person like Tucker who was paying attention
to the road. A liability scheme that, for instance, finds the Distracted Driver
more liable than the Attentive Driver would impede the ability of consumers to
use these vehicles for increased production. Therefore, courts should focus on
the ability of the person to prevent the accident, rather than what the driver was
doing prior to the accident-otherwise the utility of these vehicles could be
greatly diminished.
This comparative fault system-looking at the driver's ability to prevent
the accident-can be applied to the four scenarios from Part II. The Disabled
Driver would not be able to prevent an accident and should have no
comparative fault. On the opposite side of the spectrum, the Attentive Driver
would be able to prevent the accident, unless evidence could be introduced that
the accident could not have been prevented. Both the Diminished Capabilities
and Distracted Drivers create more complex situations. The Diminished
150. See Daly v. General Motors Corp., 575 P.2d 1162, 1172 (1978) (noting that without comparative
fault, the law "perpetuatc[s] a system which ... places ...'upon one party the entire burden of a loss for
which two are, by hypothesis, responsible."' (quoting WILLIAM PROSSER, TORTS § 67, at 433 (4th ed. 1971))).

liability).
152. See West v. Caterpillar Tractor Co., 336 So. 2d 80, 92 (Fla. 1976) ("The consumer or uscr is
entitled to believe that the product will do the job for which it was built. On the other hand, the consumer, user,
or bystander is required to exercise ordinary due care.").
153. Courts already use a similar comparative fault for other products. See, e.g., Murray v. Fairbanks
Morse, 610 F.2d 149, 159-60 (3d Cir. 1979) (electrical control panel).
154. See supra Part ll.A.2 (discussing the purposes of autonomous vehicles pertaining to people who
cannot drive for numerous reasons).

JOURNAL OF LAW, TECHNOLOGY & POLICY
Capabilities Driver could potentially stop the accident depending on the
condition causing the diminished capabilities and what the Diminished
Capabilities Driver was doing at the time. By the very nature of the
Diminished Capabilities Driver, the person will probably not have the same
reflexes and ability to assume control of the vehicle as an attentive driver. The
Distracted Driver's comparative fault would depend on the person's ability to
realize an accident was about to occur and the time available to prevent it. If
the Distracted Driver has time to prevent the accident and acts negligently in
not doing so, the Distracted Driver should assume some responsibility. If the
Distracted Driver did not have time to prevent the accident, the manufacturer
should be fully liable.
Courts should not allow manufacturers to force everyone to be an
attentive driver to protect liability.'56  If courts make everyone be on the
lookout at all times, the purposes of the vehicles-providing transportation to
those who cannot currently drive and increasing productivity157 -would be
defeated. The big advantage for the consumer in purchasing an autonomous
vehicle is to increase productivity. Further, if manufacturers advertise that the
vehicles will make people more productive and that the technology is safe, it
would not make sense to allow them to assert that a plaintiff was at fault by not
paying attention at all times.
Misuse is another defense an autonomous vehicle manufacturer might
raise.15 A manufacturer does not have a duty to protect against all misuses,
but it does have "a duty to prevent an injury caused by the foreseeable misuse
of its product."'59  The misuse defense is applicable in autonomous vehicle
products liability suits where the plaintiff has misused the car in an
unforeseeable manner, perhaps by making modifications to the vehicle.160
However, the driver of an autonomous vehicle is not "misusing" an
autonomous vehicle simply by doing other activities while behind the wheel.161
In other words, because it is foreseeable that users will not pay attention like
they do in regular vehicles, a court should reject a manufacturer's argument
that being distracted in the vehicle is misuse in the context of misuse defense.
Thus, this defense should be reserved to instances similar to when a person
modifies the vehicle that causes the technology to malfunction.
The state-of-the-art defense will often be a powerful block to design
156. A manufacturer will presumably give instructions and warnings that the driver is required to pay
attention to the road at all times.
157. See supra Part II.A.2.
158. See, e.g., General Motors Corp. v. Hopkins, 548 S.W.2d 344, 349 (Tex. 1977) ("We cannot charge

cuts.").

than the vehicle was designed to support).

SUE MY CAR NOT ME
defect and warning defect claims.162 For warning defects, courts look at what
the manufacturer could have reasonably foreseen based on current technology
and scientific knowledge at the time of production.163  For design defects,
state-of-the-art defenses "involve the feasibility of adopting curative desi n
measures to reduce or eliminate a risk of which the manufacturer is aware."
Although a manufacturer may be aware of a danger, current technological and
scientific limits may make the risk unavoidable or protecting against the risk
financially unfeasible to research.'65 This defense will be applicable in suits
involving autonomous vehicles much like it is applicable in suits involving
traditional vehicles, but it does not implicate any of the four scenarios because
it is based on the technological advances of autonomous vehicles. A plaintiff
can always argue that better technology would have prevented the accident, but
the manufacturer may be applying the latest technology at the time such that
there may well be no reasonable design alternative. This defense may also
apply to claims of design defect as to the algorithm itself. A plaintiff could
allege that the algorithm could have been written better, but the manufacturer
could argue that assessing a new risk that precipitates the accident was
technologically infeasible at the time.
While not all jurisdictions recognize assumption of risk as a defense,166 it
will play a role in autonomous vehicle products liability litigation in those
jurisdictions that do recognize it.167 The defense asserts that a "user has fully
consented to incur a risk which he or she fully comprehends."68 There are two
elements: "(1) [T]he plaintiff must know and understand the risk; and. ..
(2) the plaintiffs choice to encounter it must be free and voluntary."69 The
knowledge and understanding element requires a subjective look into the
plaintiffs state of mind to show that the plaintiff knew the risks; thus, this
defense does not take an objective look at what a reasonable plaintiff would
know.'70  Thus, to avail themselves of an assumption of risk defense,
autonomous vehicle manufacturers will need to disclose the potential risks of
autonomous vehicles to each consumer.'7' The free and voluntary element
requires that the "plaintiff ma[de] a true and meaningful choice to engage a
particular risk, presumably to advance an interest (even mere convenience) that
the plaintiff considers more valuable than avoidance of the risk."72

JOURNAL OF LAW, TECHNOLOGY & POLICY
Applying this defense to autonomous vehicles, and in particular to the
four aforementioned scenarios,'73  shows its relevance to this new
technology.174 For instance, a manufacturer could warn that the user should be
in control of the vehicle in snowy conditions.175  A manufacturer could give
clear warnings in the instruction manual or in the vehicle and perhaps have the
car communicate directly to the operator that it is snowing; thus, the user will
knowingly assume the risk of the vehicle's inability to drive safely in snow.
Assume for the sake of discussion that the user did not know, nor had any
reason to suspect that it would begin snowing when he or she begins the trip.
During the trip, the vehicle tells the driver that he or she needs to take control
of the vehicle because it is beginning to snow.
Here, which driver is in control will limit a manufacturer's ability to
successfully assert this defense. The Disabled Driver could not be said to have
assumed the risk--even if the vehicle told them it was snowing-because the
person would not be making a free and voluntary decision to encounter the risk
since the Disabled Driver cannot safely assume control of the vehicle. The
Diminished Capabilities Driver-depending on the condition of the driver 77
could be said to have assumed the risk, but the Diminished Capabilities Driver
was relying on the vehicle to drive because he or she may not be able to drive
well in snow, making it harder to say that the person freely and voluntarily
assumed the risk of letting the autonomous technology continue driving. The
Distracted Driver could be said to have assumed the risk if the person was
warned that it was snowing at that time.178 This is a just and fair result because
173. See supra Part I.B.
174. Google's user interface patent lists many different circumstances where the autonomous technology
may struggle:
Once the control computer has been engaged, it must determine whether it may
competently control aspects of the vehicle. For example, computer 110 may not be able to
control aspects of vehicle 101 safely if vehicle 101 is at a particular location which
computer 110 is unable to identify based on the geographic location of vehicle 101, if
vehicle 101 is at a particular location which is not sufficiently defined or described by
detailed map 136, or if computer 110 detects a large number of obstacles in the vicinity of
vehicle 101.
See User Interface for Displaying Internal State of Autonomous Driving Sys., U.S. Patent No. 8,260,482 (filed
July 8, 2010). Since there are many situations where the autonomous vehicle will not safely operate, if the
user does not take control of the vehicle and has been adequately warned about those situations, the
assumption of risk defense will become relevant for a subsequent accident.
175. See Marchant & Lindor, supra note 33, at 1327 (mentioning the possibility that a manufacturer may
include in the manual instructions that the owner should not use the car under certain weather conditions).
176. See supra Part II.B (describing four types of drivers).
177. The driver may be intoxicated or the driver could be a minor. See supra Part II.B.2. If the driver is
intoxicated, manufacturers may argue that he/she assumed the risk of an accident. See OWEN, supra note 97, §
17.5, at 1161. This defense will fail if the "driver does not know of and voluntarily encounters a particular
defect." See id.; see also Mercurio v. Nissan Motor Corp., 81 F. Supp. 2d 859, 861-62 (N.D. Ohio 2000)
(denying use of the assumption of risk defense because there was no evidence that the plaintiff was aware of
the exact problem that he alleged was defective). Thus, an autonomous vehicle manufacturer would need to
prove-to use the assumption of risk defense-that the plaintiff knew of, for instance, the defective algorithm;
risk of an accident alone is not enough. See Mercurio, 81 F. Supp. 2d at 861-62 ("The dangerous condition
for which Plaintiff seeks recovery is the alleged uncrashworthiness of the Nissan Altima-not the risk of an
accident generally.").
178. Here, the Distracted Driver may be reading a book and not paying attention to the road at all. If that
is the case, the Distracted Driver may not know that the weather condition changed. Without the vehicle
warning the driver of the weather condition change, it cannot be said that the Distracted Driver assumed the270 [Vol. 2013
SUE MY CAR NOT ME
the Distracted Driver can safely operate the vehicle, but the person decides to
partake in another activity.'79  If the vehicle encounters a situation where it
cannot safely drive and the person knows that it cannot safely drive, allowing
the autonomous technology to continue driving is voluntarily encountering a
risk. The Attentive Driver, like the Distracted Driver, would be said to have
assumed the risk of the vehicle driving itself through the snow. The Attentive
Driver would know that the weather condition changed and knowingly and
voluntarily made the decision to allow the vehicle to continue driving itself
rather than making the safe decision to turn off the autonomous mode. Based
on this illustration, courts should use the assumption of risk defense to help
protect manufacturers from liability where a driver knowingly and voluntarily
lets the autonomous technology continue driving, even when it cannot safely
do so.
IV. SHORTCOMINGS IN THE ABILITY OF TRADITIONAL PRODUCTS LIABILITY
DOCTRINE TO HANDLE CLAIMS INVOLVING AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
Based on the foregoing, current products liability law would struggle with
the introduction of autonomous vehicles. Products liability law needs to
accommodate the introduction of autonomous vehicles into the marketplace80
while still assigning liability for accidents to the proper party, which will often
be the party in control of the vehicle at the time the accident occurs. The
proper party will sometimes depend on what type of individual is driving the
vehicle.81
Autonomous technology manufacturers should be liable for most
accidents caused when the vehicle is in autonomous mode.182 When an
accident occurs in autonomous mode, it is probably the technology
manufacturer's fault because the technology itself was operating the vehicle,
not the traditional driver.183 As discussed below, there are circumstances when
a manufacturer should not be liable or should have its liability reduced.
The primary purpose of products liability is to ensure that manufacturers
put reasonably safe products on the market by holding them liable for harm
caused by defective products they place into the marketplace.'84  The
risk of having the autonomous vehicle drive in a condition that it cannot safely navigate.
179. See supra Part IB.1 (discussing the Distracted Driver who ignores the warning to take back
control).
180. As stated in Part 1, the introduction of the autonomous car will increase highway safety. By having
huge liability concerns, the innovation could be deterred, and society would lose the benefits of the
autonomous vehicles. See M. Ryan Calo, Open Robotics, 70 MD. L. REV. 101, 130 (2011) (stating that huge
liability concerns "could act as a significant disincentive to investments").
181. This Article uses four scenarios from Part 11.B to explore this liability scheme in more detail.
182. This should be the manufacturer of the autonomous technology, not the vehicle manufacturer. Cf
Marchant & Lindor, supra note 33, at 1339 (arguing that the vehicle manufacturer is likely to be liable for
accidents caused).
183. An obvious example of the technology not causing the accident would be an accident caused by
another vehicle.
184. See, e.g., Greenman v. Yuba Power Prods., Inc., 377 P.2d 897, 901 (Cal. 1963) ("The purpose of
[products] liability is to insure that the costs of injuries resulting from defective products are home by the
manufacturer that put such products on the market rather than by the injured persons who are powerless toNo. 2] 271
JOURNAL OF LAW, TECHNOLOGY & POLICY
manufacturer writes and controls the algorithm for the autonomous
technology. Holding manufacturers liable would, thus, ensure that they are
constantly improving and updating the algorithm, further increasing
autonomous vehicle safety. Otherwise, the manufacturer would not have a
driving force behind updating the algorithm. As stated in the risk-utility
discussion,18 a plaintiff could argue that the algorithm should have been
updated to fix the error, but that would be hard and costly for a plaintiff to
prove when taking expert testimony and the complexity of the lawsuit into
account.187  Therefore, the easiest method for courts to ensure autonomous
vehicle safety would be to hold the manufacturer liable for accidents caused in
autonomous mode.
To create an incentive for increased safety and to ensure that the party
responsible for the accident bears the liability, the autonomous technology
manufacturer should be liable rather than the automobile producer. Because
the autonomous technology will most likely be the cause of an accident that
occurs in autonomous mode, it is more practical to hold the autonomous
technology manufacturer liable. The autonomous technology manufacturer is
in the best position to adjust the algorithm and has the most incentive to avoid
costs by ensuring that the algorithm is performing properly. Admittedly the
vehicle manufacturer-if different than the autonomous technology
manufacturer 1-will also have an incentive to ensure that the vehicles are not
causing accidents, but the vehicle manufacturer will not have direct control
over the algorithm. Courts and legislatures need to take steps to hold
autonomous technology manufacturers liable for when accidents occur. This
will create certainty for the marketplace and also allow manufacturers to
include projected liability in the price of the technology.
Arguments against holding technology manufacturers liable are increased
costs and deterrence of innovation. Admittedly, technology manufacturer
liability for accidents caused during autonomous mode will result in additional
costs to them, but the manufacturer would be able to spread the costs b
incorporating them in the sale price of autonomous technology and vehicles.
The manufacturers could then adjust the price of the autonomous vehicles to
compensate them for the cost of liability.
An argument against this liability scheme could be that, by holding
manufacturers liable, innovation will be deterred. '9 That seems unlikely given
protect themselves.").

insurance premium-to reflect anticipated future payouts for liability claims.").

SUE MY CAR NOT ME
the popularity of these vehicles.192 People would probably be willing to pay
more for autonomous cars knowing that the manufacturer will be liable for
accidents caused while the vehicle is in autonomous mode. This is so because
the consumer's insurance premiums would decrease since the consumer would
no longer be at fault for accidents caused in autonomous mode, presumably
there would be fewer accidents when people no longer drive,193 and the person
could become more productive by using an autonomous vehicle.'94 Also, the
manufacturer would still be able to defend against claims, much like a
traditional driver. 1 In addition, people may actually be deterred from
purchasing autonomous vehicles if they do not necessarily trust the vehicle and
know that they will be liable for accidents that they did not cause. Thus, the
deterrence argument undermines the growing popularity these vehicles have
and the fact that consumers are willing to pay more for the increased
productivity that these vehicles will provide them. This argument also
dismisses the fact that people may hesitate purchasing these vehicles if they
bear the liability for accidents caused in autonomous mode.
Because autonomous vehicle manufacturers should be held liable for
accidents caused while the vehicle is in autonomous mode, current products
liability law will not be able to adequately assess that fault. As stated in Part
III,196 current law is too cost-prohibitive to allow for many of the suits,
whereas manufacturers could be liable similar to how traditional car drivers are
liable. Thus, courts should remedy some of these problems by altering
doctrines when applied to autonomous vehicles. The defenses, on the other
hand, are relevant and can be applied to autonomous vehicles.
The malfunction doctrinel97 can be used, but courts should not always
require plaintiffs to introduce expert witnesses to prove the case because it
could be cost prohibitive. Courts should put the burden on manufacturers to
inspect the vehicle for alterations since manufacturers will be able to best
decide what type of vehicle alterations could have affected the proper use of
autonomous technology.'98  It would also be too cost prohibitive to make
plaintiffs introduce expert testimony on every action to show that there was no
other cause of the accident.199 The other doctrine that could be used to hold
manufacturers liable is the consumer expectations test.200 The major issue is

introducing their own witnesses to prove that any alteration did not cause the accident.

litigation, many plaintiffs are tumed away because, even if they were to recover, the prospective award would

JOURNAL OF LAW, TECHNOLOGY & POLICY
that the majority of the states reject the consumer expectations test,201 so this
analysis will focus primarily on using the malfunction doctrine.
To start with the simplest scenario of a car accident, the car owner should
be liable when he or she is driving the car and the vehicle is not in autonomous
mode. The accident should be assessed to the user like a traditional car
accident. Proof that the driver was operating the vehicle for a time period prior
to the accident202 should be an absolute defense for the manufacturer against
the Distracted Driver, the Diminished Capabilities Driver, and the Attentive
Driver. With the Disabled Driver, Google and car manufacturers may need to
install technology that prohibits the user from taking control of the car.203 By
holding the manufacturer liable for accidents caused in autonomous mode, the
manufacturer will be incentivized to put in a mechanism that alerts Google
when the driver has taken control of the vehicle. The plaintiff can introduce
evidence that the vehicle malfunctioned out of autonomous driving and that it
was not caused by the driver's decision to assume control of the car to help
rebut the assignment of liability.204
Returning to the main focus of this Article, the assignment of liability is
more complicated for accidents caused in autonomous mode. The
manufacturer should be at least partially liable for accidents caused while the
vehicle is in autonomous mode. Liability should adjust based on which of the
205scenarios applies. Courts should use a type of comparative fault based on
which of the four types of drivers is behind the wheel. This type of
comparative fault should be based on whether the operator was negligent in
failing to take control of the malfunctioning vehicle and prevent the
accident.206 This requires the parties to figure out what the defendant was
doing at the time of the accident.207
With the Disabled Driver, the manufacturer should assume all of the
liability.208 Every malfunction will probably result in an accident because the
Disabled Driver cannot assume control of the vehicle-the Disabled Driver
depends upon the reasonable expectations of the ordinary consumer concerning the characteristics of this type
of product.").
201. Owen, supra note 77, at 301-02.
202. This should not apply when the driver takes control immediately before the accident, unless the
manufacturer could prove that the driver took control and was negligent, because presumably the driver took
control trying to prevent the accident. It would be entirely unjust to hold him or her liable for trying to
mitigate harm.
203. Legislatures should require this upon granting disabled people the opportunity to purchase these
vehicles.
204. An example of this situation would be if the autonomous technology was trying to override the
driver's ability to safely operate the vehicle.
205. See supra Part II.B.
206. See supra Part III.B.5 (discussing how liability should be apportioned when drivers fail to exercise
ordinary care during a malfunction).
207. This could be done through interrogatories and witness testimony.
208. This Article does not discuss the various protections that manufacturers could get from legislatures
for this type of accident. Without belaboring the obvious, a manufacturer would not have an incentive to allow
disabled people to use the vehicle if there would be runaway liability when an accident occurs. Because of the
greatly improved benefits that autonomous vehicles could provide disabled people, it would not be surprising
to see some sort of liability protection for manufacturers when a disabled person uses the vehicle. This is,
however, beyond the scope of this Article.274 [Vol. 2013
SUE MY CAR NOT ME
should not be able to assume control of the vehicle 209-and is relying fully on
the ability of the autonomous car to drive itself. When an accident occurs in
this situation, the court should hold the manufacturer liable for the injuries
caused. Reexamining Christie's situation from Part II, it becomes evident that
the manufacturer should be liable. Christie was blind, and when the vehicle
malfunctioned, she could not safely take control of the vehicle. The
manufacturer should be allowed to present defenses. A manufacturer should
be able to present evidence that the person with disabilities had the vehicle
altered, which caused the technology to fail. In addition, if a manufacturer
warns about the autonomous vehicle's inability to drive safely-for instance,
in snow and the Disabled Driver knows it is snowing before leaving-the
manufacturer should be able to assert an assumption-of-risk defense.210
On the opposite side of the spectrum is the Attentive Driver, who should
assume all the liability for the accident. Here, when the accident occurs, the
Attentive Driver will know and be able to assume control of the vehicle to
prevent the accident. Tucker, in Part II, decided to watch as the vehicle
malfunctioned, even though he could have taken control of the vehicle to
prevent the accident. He did not, and he should bear the responsibility of the
accident. The driver should be allowed to rebut this presumption by
introducing evidence that the technology allowing for user control
malfunctioned. If proven, liability should shift to the manufacturer as a
manufacturing defect.211 The user should also be allowed to introduce expert
testimony that, because of the circumstances when the technology
malfunctioned, the driver could not have prevented the accident. This could be
done by showing that, for instance, the car was surrounded by other vehicles
when it malfunctioned and in a split second hit another vehicle in the lane next
to it. In this situation, there would be little to no time at all to prevent the
accident. Thus, liability should properly shift back to the manufacturer. So in
Tucker's situation, Tucker could have introduced evidence that even if he had
attempted to take control of the vehicle to prevent the accident, he could not
have because the vehicle was in his blind spot and there was no time to prevent
the accident. If such evidence were presented, liability should shift back to the
manufacturer.
The Diminished Capabilities Driver and the Distracted Driver scenarios
present tougher challenges. The Diminished Capabilities Driver should be
partially liable for accidents depending on the person's circumstances and the
circumstances of the accident. The Diminished Capabilities Driver relies on
the ability of the autonomous vehicle. Although this person could take over
the vehicle, the Diminished Capabilities Driver would probably not be driving
209. Manufacturers should have to make a special edition of these vehicles for persons with disabilities
or the manufacturer should disable the overrides for the driver to take control of the vehicle.
210. But this should be distinguished from a situation where the Disabled Driver had no idea that it was
going to snow. See supra Part Ill.B.5.
211. Here, the plaintiff would assert a manufacturing defect that the autonomous technology in the
vehicle did not meet the manufacturer's specifications. See supra Part III.B.1 for more information concerning
this claim.No. 2] 275
JOURNAL OF LAW, TECHNOLOGY & POLICY
unless the vehicle drove itself. Courts need to carve out different levels of
comparative fault depending on the circumstances of the driver and the
accident. For instance, if the driver is a minor who is not allowed to legally
drive-and does not presumably know how to drive safely-liability should
fall on the manufacturer. With someone like Richard from Part II, 21 liability
would depend on Richard's ability to prevent the accident. In that example,
Richard could not prevent it due to his reflexes, and he should not be liable.
There is no evidence that he was negligent, since he tried to prevent the
accident to the best of his abilities. Therefore, the manufacturer should bear
responsibility for the accident. As stated above for the Attentive Driver, there
are situations in which the manufacturer should assume all liability for the
accident.
More so than the Diminished Capabilities Driver, the Distracted Driver
should have more comparative fault assessed to him or her. The Distracted
Driver, unlike the Diminished Capabilities Driver, has no impediments slowing
down his or her reflexes.213 The vehicle would need to warn the Distracted
Driver that the autonomous technology is failing. Revisiting Sarah's situation
from Part II, the manufacturer should be liable because the vehicle did not
warn her that it was malfunctioning. Once the Distracted Driver has been
warned of the technology malfunction, the Distracted Driver should be
partially liable if he or she could have prevented the accident but was negligent
in trying to do so. This would be based on the facts of each case. If the driver
could not prevent the accident, the driver should not be liable at all. But if, for
instance, the person was reading a book and the vehicle informed the
individual that the technology was malfunctioning and the vehicle is the only
car on the road, the Distracted Driver may have time to prevent a subsequent
off-road excursion. Therefore, the Distracted Driver should be liable if the
accident could have been prevented.
This liability scheme could be created judicially or, more preferably,
legislatively.214  Enacting this liability scheme legislatively would remove
uncertainty for manufacturers concerning the tort liability of autonomous
vehicles.215 If it is done judicially, manufacturers will not receive the same
certainty as to which liability scheme they will face in a particular jurisdiction
if-and when-an accident occurs.216 Legislatively, this scheme could-and
should-be adopted when a state passes an autonomous vehicle law because it
will provide more certainty to autonomous technology manufacturers when
they are researching and developing this technology, which will make them
212. See supra Part II.B.2 (discussing a scenario of an elderly driver).
213. See supra Part IB.1 (discussing the Distracted Driver scenario).
214. This is especially preferable for jurisdictions that do not recognize the malfunction doctrine or the
consumer expectations test for design defects, because those states cannot judicially handle autonomous
vehicles.
215. See Sanders, supra note 144, at 721 ("[D]cfcnse groups, from physicians to pharmaceutical
companies to automobile manufacturers, repeatedly turn to legislatures seeking relief from what they perceive

-217more willing and eager to continue innovating.
By enacting a statute, a state legislature will also help courts avoid the
problem of trying to apply products liability law to autonomous cars.218  If
legislatures do not act, state courts can apply similar principals under existing
negligence and products liability law by using a variation of the malfunction
doctrine and consumer expectations test as stated above.219
V. CONCLUSION
Autonomous vehicles have the potential to revolutionize travel and
highway safety. Within decades, autonomous vehicles will be widespread.220
The benefits to the marketplace, safety, productivity, and efficiency that
autonomous vehicles will bring have the potential to be enormous. This
Article has argued that current products liability law will not be able to
adequately assess responsibility to the party that caused the accident. This
Article proposed a liability scheme that assesses fault based on the cause of
autonomous vehicle accidents. This liability system should be adopted
legislatively to provide autonomous technology manufacturers with certainty
and to help courts assess liability appropriately. Because autonomous vehicles
will be on the market within a decade and the cars will inevitably
malfunction, legislatures and courts need to start developing liability
schemes to ensure that the party who caused the accident bears the
responsibility.
