© 2018 The AuthorsTechnological innovations have 
the potential to greatly enhance 
individuals’ health and wellbeing,1 
including in the area of transportation.2 
Rapid advancements are occurring in the area of vehicle automation, with 
extensive trials involving both personal and 
commercial vehicles taking place around 
the world. Although autonomous vehicle 
(AV) technology has progressed rapidly, 
road rules in most jurisdictions have yet to 
be modified to permit the use of vehicles in 
full autonomous mode, and governments 
have yet to develop comprehensive policy 
approaches to AVs to capitalise on the health 
benefits offered by this technology while also 
applying appropriate standards to ensure 
safety.
3,4
AVs are expected to produce important 
benefits across multiple health-related 
domains. These include crash prevention, 
emissions reduction, increased mobility (and 
therefore quality of life) for those unable to 
drive, stress reduction and increased safety 
for cyclists.5,6 Although these are substantial 
health issues that contribute to the burden of disease and require enhanced prevention 
strategies,
7-10 there is very limited recognition 
among public health researchers of the role 
that AVs can play in their amelioration.11 
Exceptions include recent efforts to draw attention to the need for the health sector to 
appreciate the potential for AVs to produce 
considerable improvements in public health 
and to develop appropriate strategies to 
manage the implementation process to 
optimise these outcomes.
2-5 Consistent 
with the Technology Acceptance Model,12 
this existing work has emphasised the 
importance of ensuring the public is aware of the individual- and societal-level health 
benefits of AVs to: i) increase the likelihood 
of adoption; and ii) encourage positive 
social norms about AVs that will be reflected 
in community support for public policies 
designed to facilitate and encourage their 
adoption. 
The public health benefits of AVs will be 
maximised when all vehicles are automated,13 
leading to calls for governments to establish 
systems to expedite rapid adoption.14,15 
Public support is a critical component of governments’ decisions to implement new 
policies,
16 and as such the relative recency 
of AVs and a general lack of understanding 
among the general public of the extent 
of their health-enhancing potential 
could constitute substantial barriers to 
governments and businesses proactively developing policies and programs designed 
to hasten adoption.14,17 
Most of the limited work to date on public attitudes to AVs has focused on perceptions 
of when AVs are likely to penetrate the 
personal automobile market, preferences 
for automated vehicles relative to human-
driven vehicles and intentions to adopt.
18-20 
Little is known about the extent to which the public specifically understands and endorses 
the health benefits of AVs, meaning there is 
inadequate information available to guide 
those seeking to improve public awareness of 
these benefits to engender support for future 
policy initiatives in this area. The aims of the 
present study were thus to assess: i) overall 
receptiveness to AVs; ii) the salience of various 
health-related benefits that have been 
reported in the literature; and iii) prompted The health benefits of autonomous vehicles:  
public awareness and receptivity in Australia

Objectives: The substantial public health benefits of autonomous vehicles will be optimised 
once all vehicles operate in autonomous mode. This form of disruptive technology will need to 
be widely accepted by the community to facilitate the regulatory and behavioural adjustments 
required to achieve rapid adoption. The aim of this study was to assess: i) receptiveness to 
autonomous vehicles; ii) the salience of various health benefits (e.g. crash prevention, emission 
reduction, driving stress reduction, cyclist safety, increased mobility for those unable to drive); 
and iii) prompted awareness of these health benefits. 
Methods: Quantitative and qualitative data were generated via a national online survey of a 
broad range of Australians aged 16 years and over (n=1,624). 
Results: There were neutral levels of receptiveness and very low salience of health benefits, but 
more substantial levels of prompted awareness of positive health outcomes. 
Conclusions: These results suggest that the public may be interested in information relating to 
the individual and societal health benefits of autonomous vehicles, which in turn may increase 
overall support for this innovation.
Implications for public health: Australians are likely to be receptive to autonomous vehicles 
when provided with information relating to their public health benefits.

© 2018 The Authorsperceptions of AV benefits across these health 
domains. Of particular interest were whether 
any substantial differences exist between 
prompted and unprompted awareness of 
health-related benefits and the implications 
for future efforts to increase receptiveness to 
AVs over time. The context of the study was 
Australia where there is a cultural propensity 
to rapidly adopt digital technologies,21 
suggesting this is a country in which policies to facilitate rapid AV adoption could be 
especially effective.
Methods
An ISO-accredited web panel provider (PureProfile) was commissioned to recruit the 
sample for an online survey. PureProfile uses 
a range of recruitment strategies to populate 
its large panel, including mass media 
advertising, online advertising and word-of-
mouth referrals. The survey was administered in April 2017 to a national sample of 1,624 
Australians aged 16 years and over (i.e. of 
legal driving age), with quotas applied to 
achieve an equal gender split and an age 
distribution similar to that of the Australian 
population.
22 Both drivers and non-drivers 
were included in the sample, although quotas 
by driving status were not pre-specified. 
The survey instrument incorporated a wide 
range of items that included those relating 
to transport in general (e.g. current methods 
of transport used for work and leisure trips) 
as well as those relating specifically to AVs. 
The first item on the topic of AVs asked 
respondents about their first thoughts when 
hearing the term “autonomous vehicles” 
(i.e. they were not provided with a technical 
definition). Most respondents reported that 
they associated this term with vehicles that drive themselves. To assess overall attitudes to AVs, respondents were then asked a 
closed-ended question: How do you feel 
about fully autonomous vehicles being widely 
used in the future?, with response options on 
a 5-point scale ranging from ‘Very negative’ 
to ‘Very positive’ . To assess the salience (i.e. 
unprompted awareness) of the health-related 
benefits of autonomous vehicles, this was 
followed by an open-ended question: What 
makes you say that? Prompted awareness of 
health-related benefits was then assessed by 
asking respondents to indicate the likelihood 
of a range of potential outcomes occurring 
as a result of the introduction of fully 
autonomous vehicles. Listed health-related 
outcomes included: Fewer traffic accidents; Roads safer for cyclists; Greater independence 
for those who can’t drive; Lower vehicle 
emissions; and Less stressful driving experience  
(adapted from Menon et al.
19). Response 
options were provided on a five-point scale 
ranging from ‘Very unlikely’ to ‘Very likely’ , 
with an additional ‘Don’t know’ option. All 
questions were forced response.
The mean ratings and the percentage of 
respondents reporting positive, neutral 
or negative responses were calculated for 
each of the prompted awareness items 
for the overall sample and across different 
demographic subgroups. The responses to 
the open-ended question were imported into 
NVivo 11 (QSR International) for coding and 
analysis. A wide variety of topics was raised by respondents, ranging from comments 
about the perceived positive and negative 
attributes of AVs to personal desires to own 
or use an AV (or not). The coding process 
was undertaken by a single coder due to 
the highly exploratory nature of the study 
that resulted in reliance on emergent coding rather than the use of a pre-established coding framework. The focus of the present 
study was on responses referring to various 
health-related benefits. Mentions of these 
benefits were assigned to relevant NVivo 
‘nodes’ to permit calculation of frequency of 
mention.
Results
Table 1 shows the demographic distribution 
of the sample and the results relating to 
receptiveness to AVs. The overall mean 
(3.17) indicates generally neutral feelings 
towards these vehicles. Around one-quarter 
of respondents indicated that they felt 
negatively about widespread use of fully 
autonomous vehicles, with the remaining 
respondents being almost equally divided 
between being neutral or positive. Males 
were significantly more likely to provide a positive response; there were no significant 
differences by age or driving status. 
When offered the opportunity to explain 
their feelings, many noted other types 
of benefits including convenience, faster 
commute times, and/or the ability to engage 
in other activities because they would be 
relieved of driving duties. The most common 
health-related responses related to an 
expectation that the number of crashes 
would decrease (21%, n=341: see Table 2). 
These comments included mentions of 
reduced drink, drugged and tired driving, 
as well as explicit statements about fewer 
crashes. However, a further 13% (n=204) 
commented that they expected the number 
of crashes to increase. Very small numbers of 
respondents mentioned emission reductions, 
enhanced mobility for the elderly/disabled or 
stress reduction, and no respondents made reference to improved conditions for cyclists.
The results for prompted awareness were very 
different to the spontaneous responses (Table 
2). Around three-quarters of respondents 
(73%) believed it was likely or very likely that 
the elderly and disabled would enjoy greater 
mobility, and about half (45%–54%) believed 
that autonomous vehicles would reduce 
crashes, emissions and stress, and that cyclist 
safety would be improved. 
Discussion
The aim of this study was to assess Australians’ 
attitudes to the advent of autonomous 
vehicles and the extent of their reported 
unprompted and prompted awareness of the Table 1: Feelings about widespread use of autonomous vehicles.

this technological advancement. The results 
indicate an overall neutral level of support, 
with somewhat higher levels exhibited by 
males relative to females. 
In terms of unprompted awareness of key 
health outcomes, there appeared to be very 
low salience of the health benefits under 
investigation. Few respondents nominated 
health-related factors as being relevant to 
their reported attitudes to AVs, and where 
a health-related factor was mentioned 
it was almost always in relation to crash 
reduction (21% of the sample). However, some respondents (13%) were concerned 
that the introduction of AVs will result in more 
crashes, illustrating the overall uncertainty 
associated with the advantages of this new 
technology. Although salience cannot be 
equated with knowledge, there appears to be 
a need for the public to be educated about 
the mechanisms via which AVs can almost 
entirely eradicate crashes by eliminating 
human error.
3,23 It has been estimated that 
achieving full automation in the Australian transport sector would save more than 1,000 
lives, 30,000 hospitalisations and $16 billion in 
crash-related costs each year.
2 Informing the 
public of these substantial benefits in terms of human life and economic savings may go 
some way towards increasing receptivity and 
encouraging adoption.
The large differences between unprompted 
and prompted awareness of the five major 
potential health benefits of AVs highlight 
the opportunity to make these anticipated 
outcomes more salient to increase the 
rate of adoption. In particular, the majority 
endorsement (73%) of the benefits that will 
accrue to those who are unable to drive 
suggests that this outcome is especially 
intuitively appealing, and hence may 
constitute an effective anchor point for initial 
efforts to increase the social acceptability 
of AVs and reduce any resistance to the 
legislative modifications necessary to 
facilitate their use. The other health benefits 
tested in this study may also be appropriate 
for public education programs, given the 
moderate levels of prompted awareness 
despite almost non-existent unprompted 
awareness. This large discrepancy suggests 
that although individuals are generally 
unaware of these benefits, many may accept 
the possibility of such outcomes once alerted 
to their existence. 
Ultimately, governments may wish to 
mandate the use of autonomous vehicles to reduce road deaths, optimise traffic flows and encourage active transport.
24 Such 
a scenario will require substantial public support because governments are reluctant 
to introduce disruptive new policies without 
majority support.
16 Efforts are therefore 
likely to be needed to overcome barriers to acceptance and to enhance appreciation 
of the individual and societal benefits that 
are projected to accrue from full vehicle 
autonomy. The Technology Acceptance 
Model draws attention to the various factors 
that influence whether an innovation is 
likely to be embraced by individuals.
12 
According to the model, intentions to use a new technology are primarily determined by 
perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use 
and attitudes towards use. In the context of 
AVs, this highlights the need for individuals 
to understand the myriad ways in which AVs 
will be useful to individuals and society to 
encourage the formation of positive attitudes 
to this new technology. The results of the 
present study suggest these outcomes 
may be facilitated by efforts to educate 
the public about the associated quality of 
life improvements for the elderly and the 
disabled if they have access to AVs, the vastly 
superior crash-prevention abilities of AVs, 
the lower levels of emissions that will result 
from smoother traffic flows, the eradication of driving stress and enhanced cyclist safety. 
Private sector actors in the AV industry may 
also be interested in disseminating public 
awareness campaigns that address these 
knowledge deficits to increase demand for 
these vehicles. 
In addition, it may be necessary for key 
stakeholders to address other attitudinal 
components that are likely to influence AV 
adoption that were outside the scope of this 
study. In particular, issues relating to cost 
and availability will be critical in determining 
whether AVs are considered a viable and attractive transportation alternative. Future research could focus on the price sensitivity of various population segments and their 
preferred AV usage scenarios (i.e. private AV 
ownership, AV ride-sharing systems, and/or 
autonomous public transportation).
Primary limitations of this study include 
confinement to one national context and 
the use of a web panel sample that may 
comprise a larger proportion of individuals 
who are more technology-savvy than the general population. These limitations may be 
overcome in future research through the use 
of international samples that are sourced via 
alternative means. A further consideration is 
that health-related outcomes such as reduced 
emissions will differ based on usage scenarios 
(e.g. personal versus pool vehicles), and future 
research could expand on the present study 
by exploring attitudes to these scenarios 
when investigating the trade-offs individuals 
are willing to make to achieve the health 
benefits of AVs. 
Other limitations relate to the way in which 
the AV items were presented. Allowing 
respondents to provide their own definitions 
of an AV rather than supplying a single 
formal definition meant that different 
respondents may have been conceptualising these vehicles in different ways. In addition, 
respondents were not asked whether 
they consider AVs to be a feasible form 
of transport, and views on this point may 
have affected their responses. Similarly, the 
prompted awareness questions did not 
include potential negative health outcomes 
that have been recognised in the literature, 
such as reduced physical activity and 
increased road congestion.
2 Strengths of 
the present study include the large national sample and the comparison of unprompted 
and prompted awareness of the health 
benefits of AVs, which is a novel contribution of the work.
In conclusion, there is likely to be vast 
potential to engender more positive attitudes 
to AVs by informing the public about the ways in which this transport innovation will 
improve the lives of individuals and enhance 
societal welfare. Australians appear to be 
largely unaware of the health benefits of 
AVs, but many exhibit a willingness to accept 
these benefits once they are presented to 
them as possible outcomes. Addressing this 
knowledge deficit represents a potentially 
effective means of increasing the demand for 
AVs once they are widely available.Table 2: Awareness of health benefits of
