I. INTRODUCTION
Cars that drive themselves may seem about as realistic as Marty McFly's
DeLorean in Back to the Future, but this is far from the case. Autonomous
technology is available and in use in many new vehicle models.' In fact, in 2010
Google announced that the company had successfully built cars capable of driving
themselves ("autonomous cars").2 Even more amazing, at its 2010 announcement,
Google also revealed its driverless cars (customized Toyota Prius models) had
logged over 100,000 miles on public roads.3 As of early 2013, Google's several
autonomous vehicles have traveled over 300,000 miles, and have yet to cause a
traffic accident.4
Autonomous vehicles are not merely a Google pet project; many automobile
manufacturers have been implementing varying degrees of autonomous technology
for years.5 More recently, luxury automakers Lexus and Audi both unveiled their
own versions of fully autonomous cars.6 One of the most fascinating aspects of the
growth in autonomous vehicle technology is the way that it could dramatically
improve the safety of automobile travel.7 Google's self-purported goal is to

eliminate all traffic fatalities. Regardless of whether Google ever reaches that
milestone, it is clear that autonomous vehicles can improve the landscape of
transportation safety and revolutionize how we travel.
The importance of autonomous vehicles, and largely the purpose for writing
this Note, is that they have the potential to drastically reduce the numerous injuries
and fatalities caused by automobile accidents.9 In 2010 there were over five
million traffic accidents in the United States.'o Those accidents resulted in nearly
1.5 million injuries and over thirty-thousand fatalities." While traffic accidents can
be caused by a variety of factors, human error is often the root cause. For example,
of the thirty-thousand. fatalities in 2010, about one-third were caused by an
individual driving with a blood alcohol level of over 0.08%.12 Unfortunately,
driving under the influence is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of human error in
automobile accidents. It is rare to find an individual who has not engaged in at
least some form of distracted driving, whether it is talking on a cell phone, texting
while driving, or checking email. Even drowsy driving causes thousands of
accidents each year.13 Autonomous vehicles have the potential to drastically
reduce, and possibly eliminate altogether traffic accidents that are caused by
human error.14
The advantages of autonomous vehicles are not limited to safety. For
example, altonomous vehicles are likely more efficient drivers than their human
counterparts.5 Ideally, a standard autonomous vehicle will likely not accelerate out
of one intersection and then slam on the brakes at the next. Accordingly, as the
number of autonomous vehicles on the road increases, emissions from automobiles

could drop dramatically.'6 In addition to the benefits to the physical environment,
autonomous vehicles could also have significant social impact. One of the most
profound potential advantages of autonomous vehicles is their accessibility to
disabled individuals for whom conventional driving is not possible. In particular,
those with visual disabilities could experience unprecedented mobility and
freedom with the advent of autonomous vehicles.
With the potential benefits of autonomous vehicles, it is no surprise that some
state legislatures have been spurred into action by the rapid progression of the
technology. For instance, on September 25, 2012, California followed Nevada's
and Florida's leads and passed a law to allow autonomous cars on California's
public roadways.17
California's new law expressly authorizes autonomous vehicles to operate on
California roads, and also directs the California Department of Motor Vehicles to
draft regulations for the operation of autonomous vehicles.18 While California,
Nevada, and Florida have taken the first important step towards addressing
autonomous vehicles, all of the legislation is very basic, and none of it begins to
address the potential liability issues with autonomous vehicles.19
With the implementation of such groundbreaking technology, the automobile
industry and transportation as we know it are likely to see significant changes in
the coming decades.20 To address these changes, the law needs to be ready to
adapt. Technology advances at a break-neck pace with new inventions and
advances emerging constantly. The law, sometimes rightly so, does not progress at

such a fast clip. While law and technology may evolve to different degrees, they
are interconnected in a variety of ways. Technology has significantly changed the
substance and practice of the law. Advances in DNA matching and ballistics are
just a handful of technological advances that have changed the law. Similarly,
changes in the law can have significant impacts on the development of technology.
If a law disfavors a particular product, either because it is unsafe or for some other
reason, it can often cripple the producer of said product. In this manner, the legal
landscape can drastically affect the way in which new technology influences
society.2'
The implementation of autonomous vehicles is a perfect example of the
relationship between the law and innovative technology. The concept of cars that
drive themselves raises a whole host of potential legal concerns. While there are
countless criminal law questions that arise with such vehicles, this Note will focus
on what may become the most significant legal hurdle for the implementation of
autonomous vehicles: products liability. To determine liability in a traditional
accident, conventional theories of liability primarily apportion liability based on
manual error by the driver. Accordingly, automobile manufacturers are not held
liable for the vast majority of the traffic accidents that occur.22 While manufacturer
liability is still present in cases where a failure of the vehicle causes an accident or
enhances the damage, the majority of the liability in traffic accidents remains with
the driver. Traditional liability becomes exponentially more confusing and difficult
to apply, however, when the "driver" of a vehicle is not a human, but rather a
complex system of interconnected machinery. The question becomes: Who is
liable when autonomous cars eventually crash?
The ultimate goal of this Note is to provide the best solution to this question.
To most effectively answer the question of liability, this Note is divided into
several distinct sections. Part II provides a basic description of how autonomous
vehicles function so as to illustrate the complexity of the legal questions these
vehicles pose. Next, an overview of products liability law is presented to detail the
relevant components of the current state of the law. Part III provides an application
of current products liability law to potential autonomous vehicle claims. Such an
application will showcase how ill-prepared products liability law is and the
potential consequences to both manufacturers and potential plaintiffs. To address
the concerns with current products liability law, Part IV suggests a no-fault
compensation system that can promote the interests of manufacturers and plaintiffs
alike.

II. BACKGROUND
Varying degrees of autonomous technology have been present in the
automobile industry for decades.23 Depending on how one defines "autonomous,"
traditional devices such as air bags and seatbelts can be qualified as autonomous
technology. In this basic sense, items that do not require human engagement to act
are the basic examples of autonomous technology.24 In relation to autonomous
vehicles, however, the true definition of "autonomous" still varies. For the
purposes of this Note, autonomous vehicle technology is defined according to a
more accepted modem definition: "technologies and developments that enable a
vehicle to assist, make decisions for, and, ultimately, replace a human driver."25
The following sections provide a foundation that is necessary to understand
the unique legal concepts that autonomous vehicles raise. Section A provides a
high-level summary of how autonomous vehicles function and also highlights the
development of the technology through the example of Google's autonomous
vehicles. Section B goes on to provide an overview of current products liability
law that would apply to autonomous vehicles-namely, manufacturing and design
defect claims.
A. Autonomous Safety Technology and the Development of the Google Car
For driverless cars to function, multiple components of autonomous
technology have to work in sync to direct the vehicle. "Autonomous vehicles,"
however, is a term that is commonly used to refer to very different technologies.
For example, two of the more common and currently used examples of
autonomous vehicle technology are Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Lane
Departure Warning Systems (LDWS).26 Both automated features assist the human
driver and reduce the potential for human error.27 ACC is similar to traditional
cruise control, except that sensors and radar work in correlation to automatically
adjust the speed of the vehicle based on the activity of the surrounding traffic
without any driver input.28 Notably though, for ACC to begin acting it must be
enabled by the driver and can likewise be disabled at the driver's request.29 LDWS

use cameras or sensors that monitor the location of the vehicle with respect to other
traffic30 and alert drivers if they begin drifting out of their lane.31 LDWS became a
priority after a 1999 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
study noted that 62,000 traffic accidents occurred as a result of drifting.32 If the
system detects drifting or changing lanes without signaling, the system will alert
the driver through audial and visual warnings.33
While both ACC and LDWS are examples of autonomous vehicle technology,
they do not spark the same legal concerns as fully autonomous vehicles because,
while ACC and LDWS are autonomous technologies in the sense that they act
automatically, they do not take full control of all vehicle functions (notably
steering), and they require driver input. As such, they are more aptly
characterized as "partial control systems."35 Partial control systems are certainly
examples of autonomous technology, but because of the difference noted above,
their presence in a car is insufficient, on its own, to consider the car an autonomous
vehicle.
The diagram from the RAND study shown below clarifies the varying degrees
of autonomous technology in vehicles. Starting on the left with conventional
automobiles, as the diagram moves to the right, the automated systems begin to
take more control of the vehicle as human input decreases.36

For purposes of consistency, any autonomous vehicle mentioned in this Note
refers to "autonomous vehicles with driver-in-the-loop," as referenced in the table.
Stated more simply, this means that the vehicle is navigating without human input,
but still with a human in the driver seat who can take control if a failure in
automation were to occur. The distinction between such an arrangement and a truly
driverless car is that in a driverless car, as the name implies, there would be no

human participant in the driver seat. While truly driverless cars are an eventual
possibility, early legislation shows that the more likely scenario is that there will
need to be a licensed human in the vehicle for the purpose of a safety backup.37
As noted in the Introduction, there are numerous automakers invested in the
development of autonomous vehicles. Google has been at the forefront of the
development in the United States, and its history of autonomous vehicle
development has been more widely publicized. Thus, this Note will focus on
autonomous vehicles as developed by Google. While the technology that powers
autonomous vehicles varies among developers, Google's model of autonomous
vehicles provides enough of a general representation to address the legal issues
presented by autonomous vehicles as a whole.
In traditional vehicles, the human driver handles virtually all of the interaction
and response between the vehicle and the surrounding environment. The driver
evaluates the surroundings (speed limit signs, lanes, weather, etc.), determines how
the vehicle will perform (change lanes, speed up, slow down, etc.), and then
ultimately decides how to execute that performance (accelerating through a turn,
how far to turn the steering wheel, etc.).38 Further, the driver must also provide
relevant information to the environment, such as waving another vehicle through
an intersection or engaging the blinker to signal a turn.39 In a traditional
automobile, the only autonomous response that the car exhibits occurs when the
environment impacts the vehicle in some manner (e.g., airbags that deploy upon
contact).40
For autonomous vehicles to function, different types of advanced
technologies, working in concert with each other, perform all of the tasks detailed
above.41 In the case of Google's fleet of autonomous vehicles, the company took
conventional Toyota Prius models and equipped them with a variety of advanced
equipment that allows the car to execute the functions of a traditional driver.42 One
of the essential components that the autonomous car uses is a rotating Light
Detection and Ranging (LiDar) unit on the roof.43 The LiDar system scans two

hundred feet around the vehicle in each direction and creates a type of three-
dimensional schematic of the car's surroundings.44 To locate the vehicle within the
environment, the left rear wheel is equipped with a position estimator.45 The LiDar
and position estimator work in conjunction with a mounted video camera and radar
sensors to "see" what is going on in the car's environment.46 This allows the car to
respond when it notes identifying features in the surrounding environment, such as
traffic lights and pedestrians.47 The last component is a sophisticated computer
located in the back of the vehicle.48 This device processes all of the real-time data
and directs the car as to how it should respond and safely interact with the
environment.49
In an oversimplified description, the computer acts similarly to a brain as it
combines and analyzes the information in order to ultimately direct the actions of
the vehicle.o The ability to analyze and direct the vehicle is an extremely
complicated process that involves complex communication between advanced
technology features, an aspect that has significant implications for the legal issues
regarding autonomous vehicles. In traditional vehicles, the human driver analyzes
the surrounding environment and makes decisions about how to direct the vehicle
based on that analysis. In autonomous vehicles, however, the computer makes this
"decision" based on data collected by the various other hardware features. This
computer-based decisionmaking raises several questions: What happens when this
decisionmaking process results in an accident? What if Google's self-driving car
swerves into oncoming traffic to avoid a toddler crossing the street?
B. Overview of Current Products Liability Law
In modem products liability cases, there are four primary claims under which
a plaintiff may seek remedy from the manufacturer or seller of a product:
negligence, breach of warranty, tortious misrepresentation, and strict liability.52 In
any products liability case, a plaintiff must show that (1) the defendant sold a
defective product, and (2) the defect was the proximate cause of the plaintiffs
injury.53 While breach of warranty and tortious misrepresentation claims may be

seem to require a more robust discussion. Further, a discussion of strict liability
largely parallels suits brought under negligence, and thus a large part of the
54analysis is similar. Moving to the different claims brought in automobile cases,
crashworthiness does not, at first glance, present any uniquely difficult issues.
While autonomous technology may modify vehicle design, the doctrine of
crashworthiness seems to be equipped to address any new issues. Thus, for
purposes of impact and brevity, this Note will primarily address autonomous cars
under a strict liability scheme and will detail liability for automobile defects that
cause accidents.
Strict products liability is considered the prominent legal theory by which
plaintiffs can recover for losses caused by defective products. The roots of strict
liability are found in Justice Traynor's concurring opinion in the case of Escola v.
Coca Cola Bottling Co.56 Justice Traynor lists several reasons supporting the
implementation of a strict liability scheme with regard to products, notably that the
manufacturers and sellers of products are better suited than the public to bear the
burden when accidents occur.57 Traynor's opinion later became embodied in the
Restatement (Second) of Torts (hereinafter Second Restatement) which ascribes
liability to one who sells a product in a "defective condition unreasonably
dangerous to the user," even if the seller has "exercised all possible care in the
preparation and sale of [the] product."58 While the Restatement (Third) of Torts:
Products Liability (hereinafter Third Restatement) has attempted to push back on
the concept of strict liability, it has not been widely recognized and the majority of
courts follow an approach more analogous to that listed in the Second
Restatement.59

Recovery under a strict liability scheme similar to that detailed in the Second
Restatement requires that a product be defective in some manner.60 There are three
primary defect claims available to plaintiffs in products liability cases: a
manufacturing defect claim, a design defect claim, and a warning defect claim
(sometimes referred to as an informational defect).61 With respect to autonomous
vehicles, manufacturing defect and design defect claims seem to present the most
profound issues. Warning defect claims generally focus on the safety information
that a seller gives a buyer and disclosure of potential risks.62 For purposes of
brevity, the following paragraphs will focus solely on manufacturing and design
defect claims.
1. Manufacturing Defect Claims
In general, strict liability in tort has been, and currently is, the preferred
method for recovery in manufacturing defect cases.63 The backbone of
manufacturing defect claims is that "while consumers may abstractly comprehend
the practical necessity of allowing imperfect production, their actual expectation
when purchasing a new product is that its important attributes, including safety,
will match those of other similar units."6 In many cases, there has been no specific
test applied to manufacturing defect claims.5 In recent years, however, courts have
begun to primarily use two different tests to apportion liability.66 The first is a
"departure from intended design" test, which functions as the name implies: when
a design departs from the original, liability may be imposed. Second is the
malfunction doctrine, which is used when circumstances suggest a product defect,
but there may be no direct evidence of one.68 Such an approach requires a more
circumstantial means of demonstrating liability.69
The departure from the intended design test stems from the Third
Restatement, which states that a product "contains a manufacturing defect when
the product departs from its intended design even though all possible care was
exercised in the preparation and marketing of the product."70 Since the publishing
of the Third Restatement in 1998, an increasing number of courts have used some
variation of this approach when defining manufacturing defects,71 and several

(holding that a manufacturing defect exists if the product differs from the manufacturer's446 [No. 1
AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES & PRODUCTS LIABILITY
states have enacted statutes defining manufacturing defects in a similar fashion.72
In statutes and cases that address manufacturing defect claims under the departure
from design theory, plaintiffs establish defectiveness either by comparing the
product that caused the incident to the manufacturer's formal design specifications,
or by comparing the faulty product with the dimensions and other parameters of
some otherwise identical product.73
In many manufacturing defect cases a plaintiff can use direct evidence that a
product had an identifiable production defect and that the defect caused the
injury.74 Sometimes a product malfunctions, however, and evidence of a defect is
not apparent, or perhaps does not exist at all. In cases where direct evidence is
seemingly unavailable, plaintiffs can still make a prima facie products liability case
under the malfunction doctrine. The malfunction doctrine is similar to a res ipsa
loquitur approach, and a court may allow the inference of a defect if (1) the
product malfunctioned, (2) the malfunction occurred during regular and proper use
of the product, and (3) the product was not altered or misused in such a way that
could cause the malfunction.77 While the malfunction doctrine and res ipsa
loquitur share several aspects in common, scholars and courts are quick to note
that a res ipsa loquitur approach is different because it still raises the question of
negligence, whereas the malfunction doctrine works under strict liability where
negligence is not applicable.
In applying the malfunction doctrine, courts generally take one of two
approaches. Some courts treat the malfunction doctrine as a strict test, whereas
others treat it as more of a principle of evidence that allows circumstantial
intended design or other pieces from the same line); McKenzie v. S K Hand Tool Corp.,
650 N.E.2d 612, 616 (111. App. Ct. 1995) (finding a manufacturing defect "because the

manufacturer's specifications"); Allstate Ins. Co. v. Ford Motor Co., 772 So. 2d 339, 344
(La. Ct. App. 2000) (holding a manufacturing defect exists where a "product deviated in a
material way from the manufacturer's specifications or performance standards for the
product or from otherwise identical products manufactured by the same manufacturer").

as the indeterminate defect theory. See Myrlak v. Port Auth., 723 A.2d 45, 55-56 (N.J.
1999). A last variation of the same principle is called a general defect. See Corcoran v.

evidence to be used to infer a defect.79 The malfunction doctrine as embodied in
the Third Restatementso is frequently applied in cases involving automobiles.1
Automobile accident cases fit well within the malfunction doctrine because in
many cases the evidence showing a manufacturing defect is entirely destroyed or
damaged beyond use. In particular, plaintiffs tend to use the malfunction doctrine
in cases of steering failures,82 brake failures,83 and cases where inexplicable
acceleration causes an accident.84 While the malfunction doctrine offers an
attractive option for plaintiffs in automobile products liability cases, it is not
limitless. Courts note that while the doctrine does provide for the admission of
circumstantial evidence to show a defect, "the law will not allow plaintiffs or juries
to rely on guess, conjecture, or speculation."85
2. Design Defect Claims
Design defect claims generally highlight defects that have the potential to be
much more widespread and catastrophic86 while manufacturing defect claims
usually address a single incident where an anomaly in the manufacturing process
has caused an unsafe alteration to one product.87 Design defect claims generally

distribution." RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS: PRODUCTS LIABILITY § 3 (1998).

involve numerous products and sometimes even an entire line of automobiles.88
When plaintiffs make a design defect claim, they are not asserting that an
individual product was defective because it was not built according to the design
specifications-as would be the case in a manufacturing defect claim-but that the
design as a whole was defective.89 This presents a much larger issue for
manufacturers and retailers because, if the design defect claim is valid, then defects
exist in their entire line of products, subjecting them to potentially massive liability
costs. Automobile design defects are often the cause of major product safety
recalls, and if not quickly remedied, could bring about massive class action
lawsuits.90
Nearly all states follow some variation of the Second Restatement's
embodiment of design defect, which ascribes strict liability to manufacturers or
retailers if the design is defective and unreasonably dangerous.91 While the Third
Restatement seemingly has attempted to push back at the notion of strict liability
for design defect, courts still tend to follow a rule that is more in line with the
Second Restatement.92 When deciding design defect claims, courts use two primary
tests to determine the defectiveness of a design: (1) the consumer expectations test,
and (2) the risk-utility test.93
The consumer expectations test evaluates the defectiveness of a design based
on whether "the danger posed by the design is greater than an ordinary consumer
would expect when using the product in an intended or reasonably foreseeable
manner."94 Under the consumer expectations test, consumers must have "sufficient
knowledge or familiarity with the design of the product to have reasonable
expectations about its safety and performance."95 Although such a definition is

distribution, and the omission of the alternative design renders the product not

applicable in some cases, the consumer expectations test is often difficult to apply
to complex products such as automobiles.96
While the consumer expectations test is still in use in certain jurisdictions,
there has been some discontent with its application.97 As a result, the risk-utility
test has emerged as the dominant test in design defect claims.98 Under the risk-
utility test, plaintiffs can succeed in proving a design defect if they demonstrate
"the product's design proximately caused [their] injury and the defendant fails to
establish, in light of the relevant factors, that, on balance, the benefits of the
challenged design outweigh the risk of danger inherent in such design."99
Analysis under the risk-utility test falls in line with principles first set forth in
an article by Dean John Wade, the American Law Institute's Reporter for the
Second Restatement.00 Dean Wade lists seven factors to weigh in considering the
risk-utility test:
(1) The usefulness and desirability of the-product-it's utility to the user
and to the public as a whole.
(2) The safety aspects of the product-the likelihood that it will cause
injury, and the probable seriousness of the injury.
(3) The availability of a substitute product which would meet the same
need and not be as unsafe.
(4) The manufacturer's ability to eliminate the unsafe character of the
product without impairing its usefulness or making it too expensive to
maintain its utility.
(5) The user's ability to avoid danger by the exercise of care in the use of
the product.
(6) The user's anticipated awareness of the dangers inherent in the
product and their avoidability, because of general public knowledge of
the obvious condition of the product, or of the existence of suitable
warnings or instructions.
(7) The feasibility, on the part of the manufacturer, of spreading the loss
by setting the price of the product or carrying liability insurance. fo
These factors are used to aid the court in deciding when there is a defect in design,
but due to the nature of their composition, often result in a subjective analysis of
defect. The ultimate goal of the risk-utility test is to determine if an accident could

have caused less damage or been avoided altogether if a reasonable alternative
design had been used.102
Both the consumer expectations test and risk-utility test have been applied to
cases involving automobile design defects. Each theory presents its own
advantages and disadvantages, and as such, some states use a combination of the
two tests.103 Regardless of which theory is applied, or even if a combination of the
two is used, each approach can ultimately require a subjective analysis by the
decisionmaker. Especially in cases of new technology, it becomes increasingly
difficult to determine reasonable expectations about a product and its safety
features. Further, when a technology is novel, it is more difficult to determine if an
alternative design-if there is one-would have provided better safety.

According to U.S. census data, from 2006 until 2009 in the United States
alone, there were over thirty million automobile accidents resulting in over one
hundred thousand fatalities.'04 Of the thousands of traffic accidents that occur each
day, human error is involved in many of those cases.'0o If early estimates about
autonomous vehicles prove to be even close to accurate, their widespread
implementation could lead to one of the greatest safety advances in decades.'06
Especially in cases where distracted driving causes an accident, such as with
drowsy driving or use of a cell phone, autonomous cars have serious potential to
make the roadways a safer place for everyone involved.
While the potential safety benefits of autonomous vehicles are fairly clear, the
legal course for them is not. There are thousands of vehicle accidents each day, and
while autonomous vehicles are likely to be much safer than their human
counterparts, they will inevitably be involved in accidents.'0o The following
sections will address autonomous vehicle accidents and two potential forms of
liability. Section A shows that applying conventional products liability law to
autonomous vehicles will be difficult and inconsistent, will likely harm consumers
and potential plaintiffs, and will delay the implementation of a beneficial safety

suggests a federal no-fault compensation system, similar to the system used for
vaccine product claims, as a more efficient and stable regime for liability claims
relating to autonomous vehicles.
A. Problems Applying Current Products Liability Law to Autonomous Vehicles
Products liability cases involving traditional automobiles are difficult enough
as it is.'08 Manufacturers may be subjected to liability even in cases where no
definitive evidence of defect can be shown.109 On the flip side, injured plaintiffs
may suffer because of the difficulty involved in proving a defect in complicated
technology like automobiles.o The consequences to both manufacturers and
plaintiffs will likely only become more difficult with the advent of autonomous
vehicles. The following sections address the problems associated with bringing a
claim involving an autonomous vehicle. Section 1 provides an analysis of
autonomous vehicle crashes for manufacturing defect claims, and Section 2 does
the same for design defect claims.
1. Autonomous Vehicles Under a Manufacturing Defect Claim
Autonomous vehicles, when implemented, will likely cause a significant shift
in liability away from customers and onto manufacturers."' The extent to which
this will occur will largely depend on the development of the law relating to
autonomous vehicles. Currently, states have been hesitant to give autonomous
vehicles full control, and the early state statutes that address autonomous vehicles
require a licensed driver to be able to take control of the vehicle in the event of
some system failure."12 Under such statutes, it seems possible that manufacturers
could deflect some liability for accidents based on principles similar to human
failures in traditional accidents.

AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES & PRODUCTS LIABILITY
Nevertheless, autonomous vehicles are generally designed to replace human
intervention with a safer alternative.' By having the vehicle perform the tasks of
a human driver, however, manufacturers risk the vehicle incurring the same
liability that a human driver would. How long it will take for autonomous cars to
replace human drivers is uncertain,'l4 but it is inevitable that these vehicles are
going to cause accidents, and plaintiffs will inevitably seek recourse. Of the
products liability claims discussed in this Note, manufacturing defect claims are
the most natural means to address autonomous vehicles. While manufacturing
defect claims may currently be best suited to address autonomous vehicles, they
are not without significant problems, Namely, this Note argues that manufacturing
defect claims could provide significant obstacles to plaintiffs seeking redress,
enhance the uncertainty of liability costs to manufacturers, and ultimately slow the
implementation of autonomous vehicles.
While autonomous vehicles will present unique issues and hurdles under
manufacturing defect claims, it is important to note that there are many instances
where such claims may be well equipped to deal with autonomous vehicles. If a
radar sensor is not installed according to specifications and that faulty installation
causes an accident, the manufacturer will be liable. In general, it seems apparent if
autonomous vehicles are manufactured incorrectly or components fail, liability will
fall to the manufacturer. In such clear situations, the manufacturing defect test is
completely capable of addressing autonomous vehicles defects. While these claims
will afford future plaintiffs redress, they will likely not occur with any type of
frequency. Advances in manufacturing and fabrication technology have reduced
the rate of defects and will likely continue to improve in the future.'"s
Autonomous vehicles are likely-to improve the safety of vehicle travel, but it
will be many years, if ever, before human drivers are ultimately replaced. What
that means is that there will continue to be drivers who drive while drowsy or are
distracted by their cell phones, and ultimately there will continue to be human error
in driving. While autonomous cars will likely enhance vehicle travel safety, it is
seemingly impossible that they will be able to navigate the roads entirely without
incident.
In addition to cases where a defect in production is clear, the malfunction
doctrine can also offer an avenue for recovery in cases where autonomous vehicles
crash, but no direct evidence of a defect is available."16 Recall that the malfunction
doctrine contains three basic elements: (1) the product malfunctioned, (2) the
malfunction occurred during a regular and proper use of the product, and (3) the
product was not altered or misused in a way that could lead to the malfunction."'
By allowing circumstantial evidence, the malfunction doctrine allows a

UTAH LAW REVIEW
decisionmaker to infer the presence of a defect.'18 While this aspect of the
malfunction doctrine can be applicable to autonomous vehicles, it presents
problems for both manufacturers and plaintiffs.
The malfunction doctrine would likely negatively affect manufacturers of
autonomous vehicles because it could subject them to liability in cases where no
defect was present. Driving is a notoriously unsafe practice, and while autonomous
vehicles can improve that, it is still a risk-involved activity. With traditional human
drivers behind the wheel there are occasionally no-fault accidents. Cars crash, but
responsibility is not necessarily pinned on one specific individual. With
autonomous cars, that would likely change. The malfunction doctrine permits
manufacturing defect claims where evidence allows the inference of a defect. At a
very basic level, autonomous vehicles take control away from the driver and place
it with the vehicle. In cases where autonomous vehicles crash, the very fact that the
vehicle crashed seems to be evidence that supports a defect. Autonomous vehicles
are not intended to crash, and so when one does, it would seem that plaintiffs
would be incentivized to bring a products liability suit under the malfunction
doctrine.
It will likely take considerable time for courts to develop a predictable
jurisprudence with respect to the malfunction doctrine as applied to autonomous
vehicles. If plaintiffs are incentivized to bring a manufacturing defect claim every
time an autonomous vehicle crashes, then during such a period the costs of
defending constant product liability claims would place a heavy burden on
manufacturers. While predictions are that autonomous vehicles will be safer than
their human driver counterparts, it is impossible to predict how frequently they will
be involved in accidents. Regardless of the circumstances of a potential accident,
because autonomous vehicles take control away from a human driver, any crash
draws the manufacturer's liability into question. Thus, it is certainly rational for
manufacturers to be reluctant to subject themselves to such speculative liability. If
the economic incentive is overcome by the costs of potential litigation, society may
be deprived of the significant safety benefits that autonomous vehicle could
provide.
The malfunction doctrine also presents problems for plaintiffs. It is entirely
conceivable that an autonomous vehicle may crash while operating in a fully
functional capacity. For instance, imagine a toddler runs across the street in front
of an autonomous car and the car slams on the brakes and swerves to avoid the
toddler, ultimately crashing into another vehicle. The car did not have a defect that
caused the accident, but performed according to design when swerving to avoid the
toddler. With traditional vehicles, when a driver overreacts to an environmental
circumstance and causes an accident, the driver is liable.
When human drivers operate a vehicle, they analyze their surroundings, make
decisions, and take action. Autonomous vehicles however, require a computer to
make such decisions based on the environment around the vehicle."9 As a result,

the malfunction theory gets significantly more complex when applied to
autonomous vehicles. Everything on the car could be functioning according to
specifications, but the vehicle just interprets the data in a way that ultimately
causes an accident. Effectively then, when no direct evidence of a defect is present,
plaintiffs will have to question the "decision" made by the technology. Such an
allegation does not necessarily imply the vehicle malfunctioned according to the
traditional use of the malfunction theory.
A computer incorrectly interpreting data is not the same as a steering wheel
that locks, an accelerator that gets stuck, or a vehicle that catches on fire. The
malfunction theory, at its most basic level, requires that plaintiffs allege some type
of defect and allege the accident would not have happened but for that defect.120
The hypothetical situation posed above shows that it is not a stretch to believe that
an autonomous vehicle could cause an accident without having some defect that
causes a malfunction. Driving is filled with a multitude of variables that play into a
human driver's choice of action, and the same applies to autonomous vehicles.
Thus, a plaintiff seeking to establish a manufacturing defect under the malfunction
theory would have to prove the decision made by an autonomous vehicle would
likely not have occurred but for some abnormality created by a failure in the
manufacturing process.
Manufacturing defect claims as applied to autonomous vehicles could have
two vastly different effects. On one hand, it could open up manufacturers to
liability for basically any crash that involves an autonomous car. Autonomous
vehicles take control from the human driver, and thus any crash could imply a
defect in the production of the vehicle. On the other hand, a plaintiff could have an
exceedingly difficult time proving that an autonomous vehicle's response to its
environment is a result of an abnormality in design. Regardless of who
manufacturing defect claims ultimately benefit, the effect on the development of
autonomous vehicles would be negative. If manufacturers are subjected to
increased liability, then development will likely not be as aggressively pursued.
But if plaintiffs are denied recovery, then there may be less incentive to buy, and
thus a decreased market for autonomous vehicles. With the huge potential safety
benefits that autonomous vehicles could provide, any such scenario would
ultimately be of consequence to the general public.
2. Autonomous Vehicles Under a Design Defect Claim
Advances in manufacturing technology make it unlikely that a large number
of manufacturing defect suits would ultimately occur. 12 Thus, the majority of
claims relating to autonomous vehicles would likely be brought under design

defect. But design defect claims are also fraught with problems and are likely less
equipped to address autonomous car accidents than are manufacturing defect
claims. The following paragraphs will show that both the consumer expectations
test and the risk-utility test present significant hurdles for plaintiffs pursuing design
defect claims for autonomous cars. Such hurdles would essentially make design
defect claims unavailable to any plaintiffs injured by autonomous cars.
The first and less frequently used test for design defect is the consumer
expectations test.122 At its core, this test seeks to prove the existence of a design
defect based on evidence that a product does not conform to the reasonable
expectations of a consumer.123 In some cases the consumer expectations test is a
usable means of identifying a design defect. If a hammer is designed in such a way
that the head flies off, the consumer expectations test fits well. A reasonable
consumer would expect a hammer to perform its function of impacting nails
without the head becoming dislodged and injuring someone. In such a scenario,
consumers have common general expectations about the use of the product and are
familiar with the functionality of a hammer. Further, because hammers are a
simple product, users' safety expectations can be articulated with a fair degree of
consistency.
The difficulty with applying the consumer expectations test is that not every
product is as simple as a hammer. As products become increasingly more complex,
a great deal of uncertainty can arise with the consumer expectations test, primarily
because the test largely stems from the negligence principle of reasonableness on
the part of the ordinary consumer. The difficulty arises in determining where to
draw the line for the basis of reasonableness. In the case of the traditional
automobile, a very complex product, it becomes more difficult to apply the
principle of reasonableness. A mechanic's reasonable expectations about
automobiles will likely be significantly different than a grandmother who only
drives to church and back on Sundays. The challenge then becomes how specific a
court will be when defining a reasonable consumer. Is an ordinary consumer an
educated consumer, one with a mechanical engineering degree, or one who has a
mechanical engineering degree who works for Ford? Depending on where courts
draw the line, the expectations that courts deem "reasonable" may differ widely.
Autonomous vehicles only exacerbate the present problems with the
consumer expectations test. A basic tenet of the consumer expectations test is that
a consumer needs to have "sufficient knowledge or familiarity with the design of
the product to have reasonable expectations about its safety or performance."l24
The technology that allows these vehicles to function is extremely advanced and
novel, thus there are likely few individuals who have the requisite knowledge to
have a reasonable expectation about the safety of these vehicles.125 This basically

eliminates for many years the consumer expectations test for plaintiffs injured by
autonomous vehicles. Consumers will certainly have expectations about how
autonomous vehicles will function, but considering that some courts choose not to
apply the consumer expectations test to devices such as airbags, it will likely be a
considerable time until courts are comfortable applying the test to autonomous
126cars.
The second test commonly applied to design defect claims, the risk-utility
test, would likely prove as difficult to apply as the consumer expectations test. The
risk-utility test focuses on the safety benefits of a proposed design compared to
alternative models in the same category.127 Early in the implementation of
autonomous vehicles, the risk-utility test will likely not afford any remedy to
plaintiffs. Dean Wade proposed seven factors to consider in the risk-utility test.128
Of those seven factors, three could be of particular interest when applied to
autonomous vehicles. First, is "[t]he availability of a substitute product which
would meet the same need and not be as unsafe."l29 Second, is "[t]he usefulness
and desirability of the product-its utility to the user and to the public as a
whole."30 Third, is "[t]he user's anticipated awareness of the dangers inherent in
the product and their avoidability, because of general public knowledge of the
obvious condition of the product, or of the existence of suitable warnings or
instructions."'3'
The first factor at issue focuses on the availability of alternate products that
would perform the same functions and be less unsafe.132 It will likely be
considerable time until there are a sufficient number of manufacturers involved in
the production of autonomous vehicles. Accordingly, potential plaintiffs would be
limited in their ability to show that there are safer alternate designs available.
Another interesting issue under the risk-utility test involves the social utility
that autonomous vehicles serve. Analyzing autonomous vehicles under Dean
Wade's second factor could show there is a strong case in support of the argument
that autonomous vehicles' utility to the public as a whole is considerable.
Specifically, autonomous vehicles are likely to be significantly safer than human
drivers,33 and thus are of substantial utility to public safety.134 Furthermore, they
will be of great utility to people with disabilities who cannot drive standard
vehicles. Accordingly, manufacturers would seem to largely benefit from such a

UTAH LAW REVIEW
consideration under the risk-utility test. When the utility of a product is
considerable, it lends evidence that there may not have been a design defect.
The factor that becomes increasingly interesting when applied to autonomous
vehicles is "the user's anticipated awareness of the dangers inherent in the product
and their avoidability, because of general public knowledge of the obvious
condition of the product, or of the existence of suitable warnings or
instructions."i3s In particular, it is interesting to hypothesize what potential
autonomous vehicle purchasers will expect as the inherent danger of the cars. This
question because more difficult in light of the current legislation regarding
autonomous vehicles, which requires a licensed driver to be present as a backup to
the technology.136 The fact that the law requires a driver to be present as a backup
seems to support the idea that the car may fail, in which case the driver would be
forced to take over. If this remains the case, then individuals whose autonomous
vehicles crash may be without recourse. Specifically, they would lack evidence
that they were not aware of the "dangers inherent in the product."'37
Whether it is the consumer expectations or risk-utility test that is used,
plaintiffs will likely have a difficult time bringing design defect claims against
autonomous vehicle manufacturers. The technology is novel and complex, and it
could be years before consumers can develop consistent safety expectations about
the vehicles. The consumer expectations test would be difficult to apply in the
early years of implementation. Further, the factors presented by Dean Wade would
seem to support autonomous vehicle manufacturers. Absent a clear defect in
design, autonomous vehicles present such a profound potential safety benefit that
courts may be swayed to rarely find design defects. The limited alternate models
and the clear possible risks would also lessen plaintiffs chances of success.
B. The Need for a No-Fault Scheme for Autonomous Vehicles
Current products liability claims will be difficult to apply to autonomous
vehicles and will ultimately disadvantage both plaintiffs and manufacturers.138
Plaintiffs will be limited in the claims that they can bring relating to autonomous
vehicles. Those remaining claims will involve complex legal issues that will likely
result in expensive and elaborate lawsuits. For manufacturers, the implementation
of autonomous vehicles presents a significant shift in the layout of liability for
accidents.139 Further, the jurisprudence on the matter will likely take some time to
stabilize.140 The combination of the two makes cost predictions about autonomous

vehicles uncertain, which will likely delay the widespread availability of
autonomous vehicles.141
For many products, the problems detailed above would not be of significant
concern to the public as a whole. Many would argue that delaying the time that a
new ladder or new child's toy takes to hit the market would be of no substantial
concern. However, autonomous vehicles require a different sort of analysis. In
2010 there were over 5.4 million traffic accidents in the United States.142 Those
accidents resulted in over two million injuries and over thirty thousand fatalities.143
Of the thirty thousand fatalities in 2010, about one-third were caused by an
individual driving with a blood alcohol level of over 0.08%, and many more were
also caused by human error.144 It is undeniable that too many Americans have been
injured or killed in automobile accidents, many of which could have been avoided
if the driver had not been distracted or made a poor decision. The sum total of
these accidents likely results in millions of dollars in costs for healthcare,
insurance, and damage repair. Overall, the damage caused by automobiles, in
particular human error in automobiles, takes a heavy toll on society.
Autonomous cars have the ability to change all of that. If fully implemented,
accidents caused by a drunk driver could be completely eliminated. An individual
could leave the bar, have his car pick him up, and never put other drivers at risk.145
Further, the disabled and the elderly could enjoy unprecedented levels of
mobility.146 The environment would benefit as travel becomes more efficient.
Productivity and individual freedom could skyrocket as individuals gain
significantly more free time. The benefits of autonomous vehicles are profound,
and their implementation is of the upmost importance for all of the above reasons
and more.
While such a utopian world created by autonomous cars is likely far in the
future, society cannot afford to delay the use of these vehicles in our day-to-day
lives. Thirty-thousand people die each year in traffic accidents, and this technology
has the potential to change 'that.147 For these reasons, a no-fault compensation
scheme, similar to that created by the National Childhood Vaccination Injury Act,
should be implemented to address autonomous vehicles. Such a no-fault scheme
would create a roadmap for the future of autonomous vehicles, ease manufacturer
concerns, and ultimately encourage autonomous vehicle development. Further,
such a scheme would provide consistent and available remedies for plaintiffs who
are injured when autonomous vehicles inevitably crash.

UTAH LAW REVIEW
1. Overview of the National Childhood Vaccination Injury Act (NCVIA)
The NCVIA came about due to two primary issues during the 1980's: the
"inadequate and inconsistent nature of existing state tort remedies and the
instability of vaccine supplies due to prior litigation."I4 Vaccine makers had
become the target of considerable liability, which caused several manufacturers to
leave the market.149 Further, there was significant pressure from proplaintiff groups
who were concerned about the inconsistency of the tort system with respect to
vaccine injury claims.50 A culmination of these concerns spurred Congress to pass
the NCVIA.15'
The NCVIA created a no-fault compensation system as an alternative to the
ineffective state tort system.152 The federal system eliminated the need for
plaintiffs to demonstrate that there was a defect in the vaccine.153 Plaintiffs seeking
redress could file a petition in the United States Court of Federal Claims and
provide service on the Secretary of Health and Human Services.154 Their petition
could contain one of two claims: an on-table claim or an off-table claim.'5' An on-
table claim refers to a table that contains a list of vaccine-related injuries and
relevant timelines for pursuing those claims.16 If a petitioner cannot demonstrate
an on-table claim then they must pursue an off-table claim, which requires a higher
standard of proof and evidence of causation.157 It is important to note the NCVIA
does not entirely remove the availability of the state tort system, but rather just
requires plaintiffs to assert claims through the NCVIA first.'58 If petitioners are not
satisfied with the adjudication under the NCVIA, they can move into state or
federal court.'59 The NCVIA, however, does remove remedies in tort for injuries
that are the "unavoidable side effects" of vaccinations.160
Petitioners who successfully bring a claim are rewarded damages from the
Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund.'6' A $0.75 excise tax on recommended

vaccines is used to generate the funds for awards given to successful claimants.162
Administration of awards under the NCVIA is generally less than that of the
sometimes excessive damages awarded under tort law. By standardizing the
awards, the NCVIA provided vaccine manufacturers with more certain liability.
Further, the NCVIA provided a more efficient process for plaintiffs to seek
remedy.
2. A No-Fault Compensation System for Autonomous Vehicles
The NCVIA has several components particularly relevant to the legal
landscape surrounding autonomous vehicles. A federal no-fault system would
provide a clear picture of liability for manufacturers seeking to develop and
implement autonomous vehicles. By accurately gauging their potential liability
costs, manufacturers could better price and develop autonomous vehicles. Further,
plaintiffs would ultimately benefit from a standardized and streamlined process
similar to that created under the NCVIA. The potential pitfalls associated with
current products liability would be mitigated, and plaintiffs could seek recourse
without the complex and costly litigation they would otherwise be forced to
pursue.
While the reasoning for the enactment of the NCVIA is in some ways unique
to vaccinations, there are several similar principles relating to autonomous
vehicles. Vaccines focus on prevention and public safety. Autonomous cars do the
same. Human error while operating an automobile accounts for thousands of
American deaths each year, and autonomous vehicles have the potential to change
this.163 Further, similar to vaccinations, there will be unavoidable side effects from
using autonomous vehicles, and injuries are sure to eventually result. Autonomous
vehicles will inevitably crash, albeit hopefully less frequently, and injuries will
result. An additional similarity is that state tort systems are likely ill-equipped to
deal with autonomous vehicle liability.164 A similar pattern is likely to emerge if
manufacturers cannot ascertain a more certain road ahead for their potential
liability costs. Like vaccines, though, a lack of development in autonomous
vehicles could result in a significant consequence to public safety.
While the exact makeup of a no-fault compensation system is beyond the
scope of this Note, there are a few points to consider going forward. First, the types
of vehicles that are included under a no-fault scheme will be of the utmost
importance and should be clearly and narrowly defined. Second, both
manufacturing and design defect claims should be covered under the system, but
not informational defects. One of the most important aspects of implementing
autonomous vehicles is that the public must understand what the vehicles are truly

capable of and how the vehicles can be safely used. Lastly, the program should be
enacted for a set time. Autonomous cars are novel technology with profound
benefits but they are not the last stop. An endless no-fault compensation scheme
may deter advancements in technology by encouraging the development of
technology that only fits under the system.
IV. CONCLUSION
Autonomous vehicles have the potential to change the future of transportation,
enhance travel safety, improve the environment, help the disabled, and ultimately
bring more freedom to our daily lives. For autonomous vehicles to reach their full
potential, the legal system must be ready to adopt new policies that will advance
the interests of manufacturers and potential plaintiffs alike. The current liability
system, namely strict products liability, does not provide such an environment.
Manufacturing and design defects are ill-suited to address the unique issues raised
by autonomous vehicles. This uncertain and ill-fitting legal landscape will likely
deter manufacturers from producing autonomous vehicles and preclude those
injured by such technology from receiving an adequate remedy. A no-fault
compensation system, similar to that set up under the NCVIA would solve both
problems. Manufacturers would be able to accurately gauge liability costs and
would be encouraged to produce this new technology. Plaintiffs would benefit as
well from access to a consistent and efficient system of remedies. While a no-fault
compensation regime is a unique solution, autonomous vehicles are a unique
technology. By fostering development while maintaining legal redress, a no-fault
system will benefit society as a whole by furthering this transformative new
technology.462 [No. I
